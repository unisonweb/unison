module Network.Sendfile

-- | Simple binding for sendfile() of Linux. Used system calls:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>EntireFile -- open(), stat(), sendfile(), and close()</li>
--   <li>PartOfFile -- open(), sendfile(), and close()</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   If the size of the file is unknown when sending the entire file,
--   specifying PartOfFile is much faster.
--   
--   The fourth action argument is called when a file is sent as chunks.
--   Chucking is inevitable if the socket is non-blocking (this is the
--   default) and the file is large. The action is called after a chunk is
--   sent and before waiting the socket to be ready for writing.
sendfile :: Socket -> FilePath -> FileRange -> IO () -> IO ()

-- | Simple binding for send() and sendfile() of Linux. Used system calls:

--   <li>PartOfFile -- send(), open(), sendfile(), and close()</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   The fifth header is sent with send() + the MSG_MORE flag. If the file
--   is small enough, the header and the file is send in a single TCP
--   packet.
