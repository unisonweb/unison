<!-- it might be nice to have a gentle and concise introduction into why Unison does anything with Nix and what cachix is. -->

We can push any nix store path into our cachix cache. This is typically done with `cachix push unison <STORE_PATH>`.

Some ways to come up with a store path:

1. If you build something you get a symlink to the store path of the built thing, named `result` by default.
2. With `nix path-info`

So, you could push the unison executable with the cache with
```nix
nix build -o my-little-unison-store-path
cachix push unison my-little-unison-store-path
```
or
```nix
nix build | cachix push unison
```

We want to cache the [immediate] build dependencies of our build products, because those are the only ones actually needed to build our build products.

```nix
nix-store --query --references $(nix path-info --derivation) | xargs nix-store --realize | cachix push unison
```

Breaking down the above:

```nix
nix path-info --derivation
```
gets the store path of the derivation of the unison executable

```nix
nix-store --query --references $(nix path-info --derivation)
```
gets the store paths of the derivations of immediate dependencies of the unison executable derivation.

```nix
nix-store --query --references $(nix path-info --derivation) | xargs nix-store --realize
```
builds the above derivations if necessary and writes the resulting store paths to stdout

These paths are then fed to cachix with `| cachix push unison`.

Development environments are defined in the flake under the `devShells` key. There are a number of different development environments, and they can be entered by giving a different argument to `nix develop`. If you want to push a development environment you could do so with something like:

```nix
nix build --no-link '.#devShells.x86_64-linux.default' | cachix push unison
```
and you could push the build dependencies of the default shell with something like
```nix
nix-store --query --references $(nix path-info --derivation '.#devShells.x86_64-linux.default') | xargs nix-store --realize | cachix push unison
```

```nix
nix-store --query --references $(nix path-info --derivation '.#devShells.aarch64-darwin.default') | xargs nix-store --realize | cachix push unison
```
