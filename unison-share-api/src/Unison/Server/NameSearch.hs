-- | A @Search r@ is a small bag of functions that is used to power a search for @r@s.
--
-- There are currently two implementations of this interface:
--
-- * 'NameSearch.FromNames' which builds a name search from a 'Names' object
-- * 'NameSearch.Sqlite which builds a name search that uses a sqlite name lookup index.
--
-- You can use the individual methods of a name search or can use 'applySearch'.
