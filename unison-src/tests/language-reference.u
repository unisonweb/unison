-- ABOUT THIS DOC: meant to give a very brief overview of the language, subject to change rapidly. Just keeping this as a regular Unison file with comments for now, so we can keep it up to date as the language changes.

-- Comments start with `--` and go until the end of the line.
-- There's no block comments yet.

-- Let's start with an example, here we define a function `increment`, which adds `1` to its argument. Unison is a statically-typed language but it can infer the types of expressions from usage. Here, it will figure out that `increment` has the type `Nat -> Nat`:

increment x = x + 1

-- Note: The type `Nat` is an unsigned 64-bit integer. By default, literals like `1` without a decimal point that don't have a `+` or `-` in front are assumed to be `Nat` values. If you want them to be signed, write `+1` instead, this has type `Int`. Unison doesn't do any sort of implicit conversions between numeric types; that would be evil. 😈

-- You can tell the Unison typechecker what type you're expecting for a definition with a type signature and it will warn you with a hopefully friendly error message if it it doesn't in fact have that type. Type signatures come just before the definition. Here's an example, which also introduces the syntax for _blocks_:

increment2 : Int -> Int
increment2 x =
   -- notice the `+1` literal!
  one = +1
  -- The last expression is the result of the block
  x + one

-- A block begins after an `=` and can contain multiple definitions. The result of a block is the result of the expression that terminates the block, in this case `x + one`.

-- Note: A block's end and the start and end of each definition in the block is determined based on indentation, and within a block the definitions all start at the same indentation. More precisely, a block ends when the end of file is reached OR when there's a non-comment, non-blank line ("non-empty line") starting at a column _less_ than the starting column of the first non-empty line in the block. In this example, the `one = +1` is the first non-empty line in the block, and since it starts at column 3, every non-empty line that starts at column 3 introduces a definition of the block, and the first non-empty line with a starting column less than 3 closes the block.

-- Within a block, you can give type signatures to the definitions. And you can nest blocks - each `=` introduces a new block, whose start and end are based on these same indentation rules. Here's an example, which also introduces the syntax for tuples, and a few more basic types that come with Unison:

-- `ex` is a pair of a textual value, and a floating point number
ex : (Text, Float)
ex =
  -- notice we can give type signatures to definitions in a block
  msg : Text
  msg =
    -- Here's syntax for importing a symbol
    use Text.concatenate
    -- Anything inside "" becomes a `Text` value
    part1 = "Hello"
    part2 = ", World!!"
    -- and here's the use of `concatenate`
    concatenate part1 part2

  number = 42.24 + 92.283

  (msg, number)

-- The type `(Text, Float)` is a pair of a text value and a floating point number. The type `(Text, Int, Text)` is, yup, a triple of a text value, an `Int` value, and another `Text`. And so on: the syntax for tuples of any size is just a comma separated list in parentheses.

-- The `concatenate part1 part2` is the Unison syntax for function application. The arguments are separated by spaces. This syntax binds tighter than any infix operator, so for instance, in this program:

ex3 : Nat
ex3 = increment 2 * 2

-- ... ex3 is parsed as `(increment 2) * 2`. You can always use parentheses if you require different precedence, for instance `increment (2 * 2)`.

-- Functions whose name starts with a letter are by default called using syntax like `f arg1 arg2`. For any such function, you can put its name in backticks to write the function call infix, for instance:

-- TODO: note about wordyId identifier grammar

ex4 : Text
ex4 =
  hi = "Hello "
  world = " world!!!"
  hi `Text.concatenate` world

-- You can also define functions that are by default called with infix syntax (we call this an "operator"), for instance:

(++) : Text -> Text -> Text -- TODO, no need to require parens here
a ++ b = Text.concatenate a b

-- Here's a usage:
ex5 = "Hello" ++ " world!!"

-- You can also call any operator with prefix syntax just by putting it in parentheses:
ex6 = (++) "Good morning" " 🌞"

-- Currently, all operators in Unison have the same precedence, and are parsed from left to right. One less thing to have to remember!

precedence =
  a = 1 + 2 * 3 -- parsed as (1 + 2) * 3

  -- we can define infix functions inside a block, no problem
  x ** y = x + (2 * y)

  10 ** 11 + 2 * 43 -- parsed as (((10 ** 11) + 2) * 43)

-- let's look at a more interesting example
