``` ucm :hide

Checks for some bad type checking behavior. Some ability subtyping was
too lenient when higher-order functions were involved.

``` unison :error
foreach : (a ->{g} ()) -> [a] ->{g} ()
foreach f = cases
  [] -> ()
  x +: xs ->
    f x
    foreach f xs

forkIt : '{IO} () ->{IO} ()
forkIt e =
  _ = IO.forkComp e
  ()

thunk : '{IO,Exception} ()
thunk = do
  raise (Failure (typeLink MiscFailure) "thunk" (Any ()))

go = do
  foreach forkIt [thunk]
```

  I found an ability mismatch when checking the application

     18 |   foreach forkIt [thunk]


  When trying to match [Unit ->{𝕖75, IO, Exception} Unit] with
  [Unit ->{IO} Unit] the left hand side contained extra
  abilities: {𝕖75, Exception}

```

This comes from issue \#3513

``` unison :error
(<<) : (b ->{e} c) -> (a ->{e} b) -> a ->{e} c
(<<) f g x = f (g x)

catchAll.impl : '{IO, Exception} a ->{IO} Either Failure a
catchAll.impl thunk =
  handle tryEval do catch thunk
  with
    cases
      { x }                    -> x
      {Exception.raise f -> _} -> Left f

fancyTryEval : '{g, IO, Exception} a ->{g, IO, Exception} a
fancyTryEval = reraise << catchAll.impl
```

  The expression in red

                needs the abilities: {g76}
    but was assumed to only require: {IO, Exception}

  This is likely a result of using an un-annotated function as an argument with concrete abilities. Try adding an annotation to the function definition whose body is red.

     13 | fancyTryEval = reraise << catchAll.impl
```
