# Computable documents in Unison

Unison documentation is written in Unison and has some neat features:

* The documentation type provides a rich vocabulary of elements that go beyond markdown, including asides, callouts, tooltips, and more.
* Docs may contain Unison code which is parsed and typechecked to ensure validity. No more out of date examples that don't compile or assume a bunch of implicit context!
* Embeded examples are live and can show the results of evaluation. This uses the same evaluation cache as Unison's scratch files, allowing Unison docs to function like well-commented spreadsheets or notebooks.
* Links to other definitions are typechecked to ensure they point to valid definitions. The links are resolved to hashes and won't be broken by name changes or moving definitions around.
* Docs can be included in other docs and you can assemble documentation programmatically, using Unison code.
* There's a powerful textual syntax for all of the above, which we'll introduce next.

## Introduction

Documentation blocks start with `{{` and end with a matching `}}`. You can introduce doc blocks anywhere you'd use an expression, and you can also have anonymous documentation blocks immediately before a top-level term or type.

```unison
name = {{Alice}}
d1 = {{ Hello there {{name}}! }}

{{ An important constant, equal to @eval{ImportantConstant} }}
ImportantConstant = 41 + 1

{{
The 7 days of the week, defined as:

  @source{type DayOfWeek}
}}
unique type time.DayOfWeek = Sun | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      unique type time.DayOfWeek
      ImportantConstant     : Nat
      ImportantConstant.doc : Doc2
      d1                    : Doc2
      name                  : Doc2
      time.DayOfWeek.doc    : Doc2

```
Notice that an anonymous documentation block `{{ ... }}` before a definition `ImportantConstant` is just syntax sugar for `ImportantConstant.doc = {{ ... }}`.

You can preview what docs will look like when rendered to the console using the `display` or `docs` commands:

```ucm
.> display d1

  Hello there Alice!

.> docs ImportantConstant

  An important constant, equal to `42`

.> docs DayOfWeek

  The 7 days of the week, defined as:
  
      unique type DayOfWeek
        = Sun
        | Mon
        | Tue
        | Wed
        | Thu
        | Fri
        | Sat

```
The `docs ImportantConstant` command will look for `ImportantConstant.doc` in the file or codebase. You can do this instead of explicitly linking docs to definitions.

## Syntax guide

First, we'll load the `syntax.u` file which has examples of all the syntax:

```ucm
.> load ./unison-src/transcripts-using-base/doc.md.files/syntax.u

  I found and typechecked these definitions in
  ./unison-src/transcripts-using-base/doc.md.files/syntax.u. If
  you do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      basicFormatting     : Doc2
      doc.guide           : Doc2
      evaluation          : Doc2
      includingSource     : Doc2
      lists               : Doc2
      nonUnisonCodeBlocks : Doc2
      otherElements       : Doc2
      sqr                 : Nat -> Nat

```
Now we can review different portions of the guide.
we'll show both the pretty-printed source using `view`
and the rendered output using `display`:

```ucm
.> view basicFormatting

  basicFormatting : Doc2
  basicFormatting =

    # Basic formatting
    
      Paragraphs are separated by one or more blanklines.
      Sections have a title and 0 or more paragraphs or other
      section elements.
      
      Text can be **bold**, __italicized__, ~~strikethrough~~,
      or ''monospaced''.
      
      You can link to Unison terms, types, and external URLs:
      
      * [An external url](https://unisonweb.org)
      * {Some} is a term link; {type Optional} is a type link
      * [A named type link]({type Optional}) and
        [a named term link]({Some}). Term links are handy for
        linking to other documents!
      
      You can use ''{{ .. }}'' to escape out to regular Unison
      syntax, for instance {{ docWord "__not bold__" }}. This is
      useful for creating documents programmatically or just
      including other documents.

      `sqr : Nat -> Nat`, or you can include one or more
      signatures as a block:
    
          sqr : Nat -> Nat
      
          Nat.+ : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
    
      Or alternately:
    
          List.map : (a ->{e} b) -> [a] ->{e} [b]
    
      # Inline snippets
      
        You can include typechecked code snippets inline, for

        * `f x Nat.+ sqr 1` - the `2` says to ignore the first
          two arguments when rendering. In richer renderers, the
          `sqr` link will be clickable.
        * If your snippet expression is just a single function

      You can use three or more backticks plus a language name
      for blocks with syntax highlighting:
    
      ``` Haskell
      -- A fenced code block which isn't parsed by Unison
      reverse = foldl (flip (:)) []
      ```
    
      ``` Scala
      // A fenced code block which isn't parsed by Unison
      def reverse[A](xs: List[A]) = 
        xs.foldLeft(Nil : List[A])((acc,a) => a +: acc)
      ```
  
    There are also asides, callouts, tables, tooltips, and more.
    These don't currently have special syntax; just use the
    `{{ }}` syntax to call these functions directly.
    
        docAside : Doc2 -> Doc2
    
        docCallout : Optional Doc2 -> Doc2 -> Doc2
    
        docBlockquote : Doc2 -> Doc2
    
        docTooltip : Doc2 -> Doc2 -> Doc2
    
        docTable : [[Doc2]] -> Doc2
    
    This is an aside. (
    Some extra detail that doesn't belong in main text. )

      | This is an important callout, with an icon. The text

    a           b           A longer paragraph that will split
                            onto multiple lines, such that this
                            row occupies multiple lines in the
                            rendered table.
    Some text   More text   Zounds!
