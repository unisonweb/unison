# tests for io2.MVar

`MVar`s are mutable, sharable storage for a single value, which may or
may not be present at any given time. It is sharable in the sense that
it is safe for multiple threads to attempt simultaneous reading and
writing to and from the same MVar safely.

MVars are the building block on which many other concurrency
primitives can be built, such as Futures, Run at most once initializer
blocks, Queues, etc.

``` unison
eitherCk : (a -> Boolean) -> Either e a -> Boolean
eitherCk f = cases
  Left _ -> false
  Right x -> f x

testMvars: '{io2.IO}[Result]
testMvars _ =
  test = 'let
    test = "test"
    test2 = "test2"
    ma = MVar.new test
    check "ma should not be empty" (not (isEmpty ma))
    test0 = read ma
    test1 = take ma
    expectU "should read what you sow" test test0
    expectU "should reap what you sow" test test1
    check "ma should be empty" (isEmpty ma)
    put ma test
    test'' = swap ma test2
    expectU "swap returns old contents" test test''
    test''' = swap ma test
    expectU "swap returns old contents" test2 test'''

    ma2 = !MVar.newEmpty
    check "tryRead should succeed when not empty"
      (eitherCk (x -> not (isNone x)) (tryRead.impl ma))
    check "tryPut should fail when not empty"
      (eitherCk (b -> not b) (tryPut.impl ma test))
    check "tryTake should succeed when not empty" (not (isNone (tryTake ma)))
    check "tryTake should not succeed when empty" (isNone (tryTake ma))

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      eitherCk  : (a ->{g} Boolean) -> Either e a ->{g} Boolean
      testMvars : '{IO} [Result]
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    eitherCk  : (a ->{g} Boolean) -> Either e a ->{g} Boolean
    testMvars : '{IO} [Result]
scratch/main> io.test testMvars

    New test results:

    1. testMvars   ◉ ma should not be empty
                   ◉ should read what you sow
                   ◉ should reap what you sow
                   ◉ ma should be empty
                   ◉ swap returns old contents
                   ◉ swap returns old contents
                   ◉ tryRead should succeed when not empty
                   ◉ tryPut should fail when not empty
                   ◉ tryTake should succeed when not empty
                   ◉ tryTake should not succeed when empty
                   ◉ ma2 should be empty
                   ◉ tryTake should fail when empty
                   ◉ tryRead should fail when empty
