This transcript tests an ability check failure regression.

``` unison
structural ability Async t g where
  fork : '{Async t g, g} a -> t a
  await : t a -> a

Async.parMap : (a ->{Async t g, g} b) -> [a] ->{Async t g} [b]
Async.parMap f as =
  tasks = List.map (a -> fork '(f a)) as
  List.map await tasks
```

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      structural ability Async t g
      Async.parMap : (a ->{g, Async t g} b)
                     -> [a]
                     ->{Async t g} [b]
```

The issue was that certain ability processing was happing in less
optimal order. `g` appears both as an ability used and as a parameter
to `Async`. However, the latter occurrence is more strict. Unifying
the types `Async t g1` and `Async t g2` requires `g1` and `g2` to
be equal, while abilities that occur directly in a row are subject to
some subtyping.

However, the ability handling was just processing rows in whatever
order they occurred, and during inference it happened that `g`
occurred in the row before `Async t g`. Processing the stricter parts
first is better, becauase it can solve things more precisely and avoid
ambiguities relating to subtyping.
