Tests a former error due to bad calling conventions on delay.impl

``` unison
timingApp2 : '{IO, Exception} ()
timingApp2 _ =
  printLine "Hello"
  delay 10
  printLine "World"
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      timingApp2 : '{IO, Exception} ()
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> run timingApp2

  ()
```
