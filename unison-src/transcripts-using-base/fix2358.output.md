Tests a former error due to bad calling conventions on delay.impl

```unison
timingApp2 : '{IO, Exception} ()
timingApp2 _ = 
  printLine "Hello"
  delay 10
  printLine "World"
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      timingApp2 : '{IO, Exception} ()

```
```ucm
.> run timingApp2

  ()

```
