``` unison
foo = {{
@source{Stream.emit}
}}
```

``` ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      foo : Doc2

```
``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    foo : Doc2

```
Viewing `foo` via `scratch/main> ui` shows the correct source, but `display foo` gives us an error message (but not an error – this is incorrectly considered a successful result)

I think there are two separate issues here:

1.  this message should be considered an error, not success; and
2.  this should actually work like `ui` and give us the source of the ability member, not complain about there being no such term in the codebase.

``` ucm
scratch/main> display foo

      -- The name #rfi1v9429f is assigned to the reference
      ShortHash {prefix =
      "rfi1v9429f9qluv533l2iba77aadttilrpmnhljfapfnfa6sru2nr8ibpqvib9nc4s4nb9s1as45upsfqfqe6ivqi2p82b2vd866it8",
      cycle = Nothing, cid = Nothing}, which is missing from the
      codebase.
      Tip: You might need to repair the codebase manually.

```
