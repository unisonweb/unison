`Stream.emit` is an ability member, not a term, so the source needs to be handled differently.

``` unison
foo = {{
@source{Stream.emit}
}}
```

``` ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      foo : Doc2

```
``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    foo : Doc2

scratch/main> view foo

  foo : Doc2
  foo = {{     @source{emit} }}

```
