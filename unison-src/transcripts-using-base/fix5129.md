Checks for some bad type checking behavior. Some ability subtyping was
too lenient when higher-order functions were involved.

``` unison :error
foreach : (a ->{g} ()) -> [a] ->{g} ()
foreach f = cases
  [] -> ()
  x +: xs ->
    f x
    foreach f xs

forkIt : '{IO} () ->{IO} ()
forkIt e =
  _ = IO.forkComp e
  ()

thunk : '{IO,Exception} ()
thunk = do
  raise (Failure (typeLink MiscFailure) "thunk" (Any ()))

go = do
  foreach forkIt [thunk]
```

This comes from issue #3513

``` unison :error
(<<) : (b ->{e} c) -> (a ->{e} b) -> a ->{e} c
(<<) f g x = f (g x)

catchAll.impl : '{IO, Exception} a ->{IO} Either Failure a
catchAll.impl thunk =
  handle tryEval do catch thunk
  with
    cases
      { x }                    -> x
      {Exception.raise f -> _} -> Left f

fancyTryEval : '{g, IO, Exception} a ->{g, IO, Exception} a
fancyTryEval = reraise << catchAll.impl
```
