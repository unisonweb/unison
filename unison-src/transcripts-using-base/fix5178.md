```unison
foo = {{
@source{Stream.emit}
}}
```

```ucm
scratch/main> add
```

Viewing `foo` via `scratch/main> ui` shows the correct source, but `display foo` gives us an error message (but not an error – this is incorrectly considered a successful result)

I think there are two separate issues here:

1. this message should be considered an error, not success; and
2. this should actually work like `ui` and give us the source of the ability member, not complain about there being no such term in the codebase.

```ucm:incorrect
scratch/main> display foo
```
