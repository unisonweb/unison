  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found a value of type:   Nat
  where I expected to find:  Unit -> Nat
  
      1 | missingDo : 'Nat
      2 | missingDo = 2
  
    from right here:
  
      2 | missingDo = 2
  I expected the expression to be delayed, but it was not.
  Are you missing a `do`?

  I found a value of type:   Unit ->{ùïñ} Nat
  where I expected to find:  Nat
  
      1 | superfluousDo : Nat
      2 | superfluousDo = do
      3 |   2
  
    from right here:
  
      3 |   2
  
  I didn't expect this expression to be delayed, but it was.
  Are you using a `do` where you don't need one,
  or are you missing a `()` to force an expression?
