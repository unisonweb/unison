  Done.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in
  unison-src/transcripts/fix2795/docs.u. If you do an `add` or
  `update`, here's how your codebase would change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      t1   : Text
      test : Doc2

.> display test

      t : Text
      t = "hi"
      t
      ⧨
      "hi"
  
      t1 = "hi"

```
