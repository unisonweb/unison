We can display the guide before and after adding it to the codebase:

```ucm

  # Unison computable documentation
  
    # Basic formatting
    
      Paragraphs are separated by one or more blanklines.
      Sections have a title and 0 or more paragraphs or other
      section elements.
    
      Text can be bold, *italicized*, ~~strikethrough~~, or
      `monospaced`.
    
      You can link to Unison terms, types, and external URLs:
    
      * An external url
      * Some is a term link; Optional is a type link
      * A named type link and a named term link. Term links are
        handy for linking to other documents!
    
      You can use `{{ .. }}` to escape out to regular Unison
      syntax, for instance __not bold__. This is useful for
      creating documents programmatically or just including
      other documents.
    
      *Next up:* lists
  
    # Lists
    
      # Bulleted lists
      
        Bulleted lists can use `+`, `-`, or `*` for the bullets
        (though the choice will be normalized away by the
        pretty-printer). They can be nested, to any depth:
      
        * A
        * B
        * C
          * C1
          * C2
    
      # Numbered lists
      
        1. A
        2. B
        3. C
      
        The first number of the list determines the starting
        number in the rendered output. The other numbers are
        ignored:
      
        10. A
        11. B
        12. C
      
        Numbered lists can be nested as well, and combined with
        bulleted lists:
      
        1. Wake up.
           * What am I doing here?
           * In this nested list.
        2. Take shower.
        3. Get dressed.
  
    # Evaluation
    
      Expressions can be evaluated inline, for instance `2`.
    
      Blocks of code can be evaluated as well, for instance:
    
          id x = x
          id (sqr 10)
          ⧨
          100
    
      also:
    
          match 1 with
            1 -> "hi"
            _ -> "goodbye"
          ⧨
          "hi"
    
      To include a typechecked snippet of code without
      evaluating it, you can do:
    
          cube x =
            use Nat *
            x * x * x
  
    # Including Unison source code
    
      Unison definitions can be included in docs. For instance:
    
          structural type Optional a = None | Some a
          
          sqr : Nat -> Nat
          sqr x =
            use Nat *
            x * x
    
      Some rendering targets also support folded source:
    
          structural type Optional a = None | Some a
          
          sqr : Nat -> Nat
          sqr x =
            use Nat *
            x * x
    
      You can also include just a signature, inline, with
      `sqr : Nat -> Nat`, or you can include one or more
      signatures as a block:
    
          sqr : Nat -> Nat
      
          Nat.+ : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
    
      Or alternately:
    
          List.map : (a ->{e} b) -> [a] ->{e} [b]
    
      # Inline snippets
      
        You can include typechecked code snippets inline, for
        instance:
      
        * `f x Nat.+ sqr 1` - the `2` says to ignore the first
          two arguments when rendering. In richer renderers, the
          `sqr` link will be clickable.
        * If your snippet expression is just a single function
          application, you can put it in double backticks, like
          so: `sqr x`. This is equivalent to `sqr x`.
  
    # Non-Unison code blocks
    
      Use three or more single quotes to start a block with no
      syntax highlighting:
    
      ``` raw
         _____     _             
        |  |  |___|_|___ ___ ___ 
        |  |  |   | |_ -| . |   |
        |_____|_|_|_|___|___|_|_|
        
      ```
    
      You can use three or more backticks plus a language name
      for blocks with syntax highlighting:
    
      ``` Haskell
      -- A fenced code block which isn't parsed by Unison
      reverse = foldl (flip (:)) []
      ```
    
      ``` Scala
      // A fenced code block which isn't parsed by Unison
      def reverse[A](xs: List[A]) = 
        xs.foldLeft(Nil : List[A])((acc,a) => a +: acc)
      ```
  
    There are also asides, callouts, tables, tooltips, and more.
    These don't currently have special syntax; just use the
    `{{ }}` syntax to call these functions directly.
    
        docAside : Doc2 -> Doc2
    
        docCallout : Optional Doc2 -> Doc2 -> Doc2
    
        docBlockquote : Doc2 -> Doc2
    
        docTooltip : Doc2 -> Doc2 -> Doc2
    
        docTable : [[Doc2]] -> Doc2
    
    This is an aside. (
    Some extra detail that doesn't belong in main text. )

      Sections have a title and 0 or more paragraphs or other
      section elements.
    
      Text can be bold, *italicized*, ~~strikethrough~~, or
      `monospaced`.
    
      You can link to Unison terms, types, and external URLs:
    
      * An external url
      * Some is a term link; Optional is a type link
      * A named type link and a named term link. Term links are
        handy for linking to other documents!
    
      You can use `{{ .. }}` to escape out to regular Unison
      syntax, for instance __not bold__. This is useful for
      creating documents programmatically or just including
      other documents.
    
      *Next up:* lists
  
    # Lists
    
      # Bulleted lists
      
        Bulleted lists can use `+`, `-`, or `*` for the bullets
        (though the choice will be normalized away by the
        pretty-printer). They can be nested, to any depth:
      
        * A
        * B
        * C
          * C1
          * C2
    
      # Numbered lists
      
        1. A
        2. B
        3. C
      
        The first number of the list determines the starting
        number in the rendered output. The other numbers are
        ignored:
      
        10. A
        11. B
        12. C
      
        Numbered lists can be nested as well, and combined with
        bulleted lists:
      
        1. Wake up.
           * What am I doing here?
           * In this nested list.
        2. Take shower.
        3. Get dressed.
  
    # Evaluation
    
      Expressions can be evaluated inline, for instance `2`.
    
      Blocks of code can be evaluated as well, for instance:
    
          id x = x
          id (sqr 10)
          ⧨
          100
    
      also:
    
          match 1 with
            1 -> "hi"
            _ -> "goodbye"
          ⧨
          "hi"
    
      To include a typechecked snippet of code without
      evaluating it, you can do:
    
          cube x =
            use Nat *
            x * x * x
  
    # Including Unison source code
    
      Unison definitions can be included in docs. For instance:
    
          structural type Optional a = None | Some a
          
          sqr : Nat -> Nat
          sqr x =
            use Nat *
            x * x
    
      Some rendering targets also support folded source:
    
          structural type Optional a = None | Some a
          
          sqr : Nat -> Nat
          sqr x =
            use Nat *
            x * x
    
      You can also include just a signature, inline, with
      `sqr : Nat -> Nat`, or you can include one or more
      signatures as a block:
    
          sqr : Nat -> Nat
      
          Nat.+ : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
    
      Or alternately:
    
          List.map : (a ->{e} b) -> [a] ->{e} [b]
    
      # Inline snippets
      
        You can include typechecked code snippets inline, for
        instance:
      
        * `f x Nat.+ sqr 1` - the `2` says to ignore the first
          two arguments when rendering. In richer renderers, the
          `sqr` link will be clickable.
        * If your snippet expression is just a single function
          application, you can put it in double backticks, like
          so: `sqr x`. This is equivalent to `sqr x`.
  
    # Non-Unison code blocks
    
      Use three or more single quotes to start a block with no
      syntax highlighting:
    
      ``` raw
         _____     _             
        |  |  |___|_|___ ___ ___ 
        |  |  |   | |_ -| . |   |
        |_____|_|_|_|___|___|_|_|
        
      ```
    
      You can use three or more backticks plus a language name
      for blocks with syntax highlighting:
    
      ``` Haskell
      -- A fenced code block which isn't parsed by Unison
      reverse = foldl (flip (:)) []
      ```
    
      ``` Scala
      // A fenced code block which isn't parsed by Unison
      def reverse[A](xs: List[A]) = 
        xs.foldLeft(Nil : List[A])((acc,a) => a +: acc)
      ```
  
    There are also asides, callouts, tables, tooltips, and more.
    These don't currently have special syntax; just use the
    `{{ }}` syntax to call these functions directly.
    
        docAside : Doc2 -> Doc2
    
        docCallout : Optional Doc2 -> Doc2 -> Doc2
    
        docBlockquote : Doc2 -> Doc2
    
        docTooltip : Doc2 -> Doc2 -> Doc2
    
        docTable : [[Doc2]] -> Doc2
    
    This is an aside. (
    Some extra detail that doesn't belong in main text. )
    
      | This is an important callout, with no icon.
    
      | 🌻

                            rendered table.

.> undo

  Here are the changes I undid
  
  Added definitions:
  
    1. rendered : Annotated () (Either SpecialForm ConsoleText)

```
And then this sometimes generates a GHC crash "strange closure error" but doesn't seem deterministic.

```unison
rendered = Pretty.get (docFormatConsole doc.guide)

> rendered
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      rendered : Annotated () (Either SpecialForm ConsoleText)
  
  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.
