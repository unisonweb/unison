# Duplicate Term Detection

Trivial duplicate terms should be detected:

```unison
x = 1
x = 2
```

```ucm

  ❗️
  
  I found multiple bindings with the name x:
      1 | x = 1
      2 | x = 2
  

```
Equivalent duplicate terms should be detected:

```unison
x = 1
x = 1
```

```ucm

  ❗️
  
  I found multiple bindings with the name x:
      1 | x = 1
      2 | x = 1
  

```
Duplicates from record accessors/setters should be detected

```unison
structural type Record = {x: Nat, y: Nat}
Record.x = 1
Record.x.set = 2
Record.x.modify = 2
```

```ucm

  ❗️
  
  I found multiple bindings with the name Record.x:
      1 | structural type Record = {x: Nat, y: Nat}
      2 | Record.x = 1
  
  
  I found multiple bindings with the name Record.x.modify:
      1 | structural type Record = {x: Nat, y: Nat}
      2 | Record.x = 1
      3 | Record.x.set = 2
      4 | Record.x.modify = 2
  
  
  I found multiple bindings with the name Record.x.set:
      1 | structural type Record = {x: Nat, y: Nat}
      2 | Record.x = 1
      3 | Record.x.set = 2
  

```
Duplicate terms and constructors should be detected:

```unison
structural type SumType = X

SumType.X = 1

structural ability AnAbility where
  thing : Nat -> ()

AnAbility.thing = 2
```

```ucm

  ❗️
  
  I found multiple bindings with the name AnAbility.thing:
      6 |   thing : Nat -> ()
      7 | 
      8 | AnAbility.thing = 2
  
  
  I found multiple bindings with the name SumType.X:
      1 | structural type SumType = X
      2 | 
      3 | SumType.X = 1
  

```
