Array comparison was indexing out of bounds.

```unison
arr = Scope.run do
  ma = Scope.arrayOf "asdf" 0
  freeze! ma

> compare arr arr
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      arr : ImmutableArray Text
  
  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.
