``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.merge
```

Pretty-printing previously didn’t compensate for extra characters on a line that was about to be wrapped, resulting in a line-break without sufficient indentation. Now pretty-printing indents based on the starting column of the wrapped expression, not simply “prevIndent + 2”.

``` unison :hide
failure msg context = Failure (typeLink Unit) msg (Any context)

foo = Left (failure ("a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong" ++ "message with concatenation") ())
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add
scratch/main> edit.new foo
scratch/main> load scratch.u
```
