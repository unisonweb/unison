``` ucm
scratch/main> builtins.mergeio

  Done.

```
The following `Doc` fails to typecheck with `ucm` `0.5.26`:

``` unison
testDoc : Doc2
testDoc = {{
  key: '{{ docWord "value" }}'.
}}
```

``` ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:
  
      3 |   key: '{{ docWord "value" }}'.
  
  
  I was surprised to find a . here.
  I was expecting one of these instead:
  
  * end of input

```
The same code typechecks ok with `0.5.25`.
