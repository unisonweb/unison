Below is an example of variable capture occuring from pattern matching.

``` unison

foo w = match (5, w) with
  x ->
    y = toText x
    match 99 with _ -> ()
    z = toText x
    (y,z)

> foo 8
```

``` ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      foo : w
            -> ( Optional (Either Text Text),
              Optional (Either Text Text))
  
  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

    9 | > foo 8
          ⧩
          (Some (Right "(5, 8)"), Some (Right "(5, 8)"))

```
Arguably, the root cause is flattening of nested lets like this one.

``` unison

bar x =
  -- argument here
  y = Debug.toText x
  let
    x = 5
    ()
  -- 5 here, before fix
  z = Debug.toText x
  (y, z)

> bar 3
```

    12 | > bar 3

```
