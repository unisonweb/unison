Tests that delaying an un-annotated higher-rank type gives a normal
type error, rather than an internal compiler error.

``` unison
f : (forall a . a -> a) -> Nat
f id = id 0

x = 'f
```

``` ucm

  I found a value of type:   (a1 ->{𝕖} a1) ->{𝕖} Nat
  where I expected to find:  (a -> 𝕣1) -> 𝕣
  
      1 | f : (forall a . a -> a) -> Nat
      2 | f id = id 0
      3 | 
      4 | x = 'f
  
    from right here:
  
      1 | f : (forall a . a -> a) -> Nat
  

```
