``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.merge
```

Pretty-printing previously didn’t compensate for extra characters on a line that was about to be wrapped, resulting in a line-break without sufficient indentation. Now pretty-printing indents based on the starting column of the wrapped expression, not simply “prevIndent + 2”.

``` unison :hide
failure msg context = Failure (typeLink Unit) msg (Any context)

foo = Left (failure ("a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong" ++ "message with concatenation") ())
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    failure : Text -> context -> Failure
    foo     : Either Failure b
scratch/main> edit foo

  ☝️

  I added 1 definitions to the top of scratch.u

  You can edit them there, then run `update` to replace the
  definitions currently in this namespace.
scratch/main> load scratch.u

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked the definitions in scratch.u. This
  file has been previously added to the codebase.
```

``` unison :added-by-ucm scratch.u
foo : Either Failure b
foo =
  use Text ++
  Left
    (failure
      ("a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong"
        ++ "message with concatenation")
      ())
```
