  Done.

  updated...

  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  I couldn't complete the update, because some existing
  definitions would no longer typecheck.

  I've created a temporary branch and added the affected
  definitions to scratch.u, where you can fix them up or remove
  any that are obsolete.

  Once you're happy with the results, use `update` to merge them
  back into main, or `cancel` if you change your mind.
```

``` unison :added-by-ucm scratch.u
type Foo = Bar Nat

-- The definitions below no longer typecheck with the changes above.
-- Please fix the errors and try `update` again.

foo : Foo -> Nat
foo = cases
  Bar n   -> n
  Baz n m -> n Nat.+ m

```
