  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      t1   : Text
      test : Doc2
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> display test

      t : Text
      t = "hi"
      t
      ⧨
      "hi"

      t1 : Text
      t1 = "hi"
```
