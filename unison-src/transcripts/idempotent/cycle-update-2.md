Update a member of a cycle with a type-preserving update, but sever the cycle.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      ping : 'Nat
      pong : 'Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    ping : 'Nat
    pong : 'Nat
```

``` unison
ping : 'Nat
ping _ = 3
```

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      ping : 'Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  Everything typechecks, so I'm saving the results...

  Done.

    use Nat +
    ping() + 2
