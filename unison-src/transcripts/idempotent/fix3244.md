This tests an previously erroneous case in the pattern compiler. It was assuming
that the variables bound in a guard matched the variables bound in the rest of
the branch exactly, but apparently this needn't be the case.

``` unison

foo t =
  (x, _) = t
  f w = w + x

  match t with
    (x, y)
      | y < 5 -> f x
      | otherwise -> x + y

> foo (10,20)
```

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      foo : (Nat, Nat) -> Nat

  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

    11 | > foo (10,20)

           30
