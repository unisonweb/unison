  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      lib.new.foo : Nat
      lib.old.foo : Nat
      thingy      : Nat
```

``` ucm
proj/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    lib.new.foo : Nat
    lib.old.foo : Nat
    thingy      : Nat
```
