This file contains programs with parse errors and type errors, for visual inspection of error message quality and to check for regressions or changes to error reporting.

## Parse errors

Some basic errors of literals.

### Floating point literals

``` unison :error
x = 1. -- missing some digits after the decimal
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  This number isn't valid syntax: 

      1 | x = 1. -- missing some digits after the decimal

  I was expecting some digits after the `.` , for example: `1.0`
  or `1.1e37`.
```

``` unison :error
x = 1e -- missing an exponent
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  This number isn't valid syntax: 

      1 | x = 1e -- missing an exponent

  I was expecting some digits for the exponent, for example:
  `1e37`.
```

``` unison :error
x = 1e- -- missing an exponent
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  This number isn't valid syntax: 

      1 | x = 1e- -- missing an exponent

  I was expecting some digits for the exponent, for example:
  `1e-37`.
```

``` unison :error
x = 1E+ -- missing an exponent
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  This number isn't valid syntax: 

      1 | x = 1E+ -- missing an exponent

  I was expecting some digits for the exponent, for example:
  `1e+37`.
```

### Hex, octal, binary, and bytes literals

``` unison :error
x = 0xoogabooga -- invalid hex chars
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  This number isn't valid syntax: 

      1 | x = 0xoogabooga -- invalid hex chars

  I was expecting only hexidecimal characters (one of
  0123456789abcdefABCDEF) after the 0x.
```

``` unison :error
x = 0o987654321 -- 9 and 8 are not valid octal char
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  This number isn't valid syntax: 

      1 | x = 0o987654321 -- 9 and 8 are not valid octal char

  I was expecting only octal characters (one of 01234567) after
  the 0o.
```

``` unison :error
x = 0b3201 -- 3 and 2 are not valid binary chars
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  This number isn't valid syntax: 

      1 | x = 0b3201 -- 3 and 2 are not valid binary chars

  I was expecting only binary characters (one of 01) after the
  0b.
```

``` unison :error
x = 0xsf -- odd number of hex chars in a bytes literal
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  This bytes literal isn't valid syntax: 0xsf

      1 | x = 0xsf -- odd number of hex chars in a bytes literal

  I was expecting an even number of hexidecimal characters (one
  of 0123456789abcdefABCDEF) after the 0xs.
```

``` unison :error
x = 0xsnotvalidhexchars -- invalid hex chars in a bytes literal
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  This bytes literal isn't valid syntax: 0xsnotvalidhexchars

      1 | x = 0xsnotvalidhexchars -- invalid hex chars in a bytes literal

  I was expecting an even number of hexidecimal characters (one
  of 0123456789abcdefABCDEF) after the 0xs.
```

### Layout errors

``` unison :error
foo = else -- not matching if
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found a closing 'else' here without a matching 'then'.

      1 | foo = else -- not matching if
```

``` unison :error
foo = then -- unclosed
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found a closing 'then' here without a matching 'if'.

      1 | foo = then -- unclosed
```

``` unison :error
foo = with -- unclosed
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found a closing 'with' here without a matching 'handle' or 'match'.

      1 | foo = with -- unclosed
```

### Matching

``` unison :error
-- No cases
foo = match 1 with
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  Pattern match doesn't cover all possible cases:
        2 | foo = match 1 with
    

  Patterns not matched:
   * _
```

``` unison :error
foo = match 1 with
  2 -- no right-hand-side
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:

      3 | 

  I was surprised to find an end of section here.
  I was expecting one of these instead:

  * ","
  * case match
  * pattern guard
```

``` unison :error
-- Mismatched arities
foo = cases
  1, 2 -> ()
  3 -> ()
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

    😶
    
    Not all the branches of this pattern matching have the same
    number of arguments. I was assuming they'd all have 2
    arguments (based on the previous patterns) but this one has
    1 arguments:
        4 |   3 -> ()
    
```

``` unison :error
-- Missing a '->'
x = match Some a with
      None ->
        1
      Some _
        2
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:

      7 | 

  I was surprised to find an end of section here.
  I was expecting one of these instead:

  * ","
  * blank
  * case match
  * false
  * pattern guard
  * true
```

``` unison :error
-- Missing patterns
x = match Some a with
      None -> 1
           -> 2
           -> 3
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:

      4 |            -> 2


  I was surprised to find a -> here.
  I was expecting one of these instead:

  * end of input
  * newline or semicolon
```

``` unison :error
-- Guards following an unguarded case
x = match Some a with
      None     -> 1
        | true -> 2
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:

      4 |         | true -> 2


  I was surprised to find a '|' here.
  I was expecting one of these instead:

  * end of input
  * newline or semicolon
```

### Watches

``` unison :error
-- Empty watch
>
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I expected a non-empty watch expression and not just ">"

      2 | >
```

### Keywords

``` unison :error
use.keyword.in.namespace = 1
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  The identifier `namespace` used here is a reserved keyword: 

      1 | use.keyword.in.namespace = 1

  You can avoid this problem either by renaming the identifier
  or wrapping it in backticks (like `namespace` ).
```

``` unison :error
-- reserved operator
a ! b = 1
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  This looks like the start of an expression here 

      2 | a ! b = 1

  but at the file top-level, I expect one of the following:

    - A binding, like a = 42 OR
                      a : Nat
                      a = 42
    - A watch expression, like > a + 1
    - An `ability` declaration, like unique ability Foo where ...
    - A `type` declaration, like structural type Optional a = None | Some a
```
