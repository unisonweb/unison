Deleting the branch you are on takes you to its parent (though this is impossible to see in a transcript, since we set
your working directory with each command).

``` ucm
foo/main> branch topic

  Done. I've created the topic branch based off of main.

  Tip: To merge your work back into the main branch, first
       `switch /main` then `merge /topic`.
foo/topic> delete.branch /topic
```

A branch need not be preceded by a forward slash.

``` ucm
foo/main> branch topic

  Done. I've created the topic branch based off of main.

  Tip: To merge your work back into the main branch, first
       `switch /main` then `merge /topic`.
foo/topic> delete.branch topic
```

You can precede the branch name by a project name.

``` ucm
foo/main> branch topic

  Done. I've created the topic branch based off of main.

  Tip: To merge your work back into the main branch, first
       `switch /main` then `merge /topic`.
scratch/main> delete.branch foo/topic
```

You can delete the only branch in a project.

``` ucm
foo/main> delete.branch /main
```

You can delete the last branch in the project, a new one will be created.

``` ucm
scratch/main> delete.branch scratch/main
scratch/main> branches

       Branch   Remote branch
  1.   main     
  2.   main2    
```

If the the last branch isn't /main, then /main will be created.

``` ucm
scratch/main2> delete.branch /main
scratch/main2> delete.branch /main2
scratch/other> branches

       Branch   Remote branch
  1.   main     
  2.   other    
```
