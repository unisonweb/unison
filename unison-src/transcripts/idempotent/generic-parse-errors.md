Just a bunch of random parse errors to test the error formatting.

``` unison :error
x =
  foo.123
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:

      2 |   foo.123


  I was surprised to find a 1 here.
  I was expecting one of these instead:

  * end of input
  * hash (ex: #af3sj3)
  * identifier (ex: abba1, snake_case, .foo.bar#xyz, .foo.++#xyz, or 🌻)
```

``` unison :error
namespace.blah = 1
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:

      1 | namespace.blah = 1

  * quote

```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  I found a closing ']' here without a matching '['.

      1 | x = 1 ]
```

``` unison :error
x = a.#abc
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:

      1 | x = a.#abc
