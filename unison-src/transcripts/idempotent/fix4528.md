  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      structural type Foo
      main : 'Foo
```

``` ucm
foo/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    structural type Foo
    main : 'Foo
foo/main> run main

  MkFoo 5
```
