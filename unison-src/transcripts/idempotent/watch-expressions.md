  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      pass : [Result]

  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

    1 | test> pass = [Ok "Passed"]
    
    ✅ Passed Passed
```
