# Unit tests for Any.unsafeExtract

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.mergeio
scratch/main> load unison-src/transcripts-using-base/base.u
scratch/main> add
```

Any.unsafeExtract is a way to extract the value contained in an Any. This is unsafe because it allows the programmer to coerce a value into any type, which would cause undefined behaviour if used to coerce a value to the wrong type.

``` unison

test> Any.unsafeExtract.works =
  use Nat !=
  checks [1 == Any.unsafeExtract (Any 1),
          not (1 == Any.unsafeExtract (Any 2)),
          (Some 1) == Any.unsafeExtract (Any (Some 1))
         ]
```

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      Any.unsafeExtract.works : [Result]

  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    Any.unsafeExtract.works : [Result]
