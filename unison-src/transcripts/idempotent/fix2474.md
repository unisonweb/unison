Tests an issue with a lack of generality of handlers.

In general, a set of cases:

``` 
{ e ... -> k }
```

should be typed in the following way:

1.  The scrutinee has type `Request {E, g} r -> s` where `E` is all
    the abilities being handled. `g` is a slack variable, because all
    abilities that are used in the handled expression pass through
    the handler. Previously this was being inferred as merely
    `Request {E} r -> s`
2.  The continuation variable `k` should have type `o ->{E, g} r`,
    matching the above types (`o` is the result type of `e`).
    Previously this was being checked as `o ->{E0} r`, where `E0` is
    the ability that contains `e`.

``` ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge

  Done.
```

``` unison
structural ability Stream a where
  emit : a -> ()

Stream.uncons : '{Stream a, g} r ->{g} Either r (a, '{Stream a, g} r)
Stream.uncons s =
  go : Request {Stream a,g} r -> Either r (a, '{Stream a,g} r)
  go = cases
    { r } -> Left r
    { Stream.emit a -> tl } -> Right (a, tl : '{Stream a,g} r)
  handle !s with go
```

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      structural ability Stream a
      Stream.uncons : '{g, Stream a} r
                      ->{g} Either r (a, '{g, Stream a} r)
```
