``` ucm :hide
scratch/a> builtins.merge lib.builtins
```

This transcript checks that updates to data types propagate successfully to dependent types and dependent terms that do pattern matching. First let's create some types and terms:

``` unison :hide
unique type A a b c d
  = A a
  | B b
  | C c
  | D d

structural type NeedsA a b = NeedsA (A a b Nat Nat)
                | Zoink Text

f : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
f = cases
  A n -> n
  _ -> 42

f2 a =
  n = f a
  n + 1

f3 : NeedsA Nat Nat -> Nat
f3 = cases
  NeedsA a -> f a + 20
  _ -> 0

g : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
g = cases
  D n -> n
  _ -> 43
```

We'll make our edits in a new branch.

``` ucm
scratch/a> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    type A a b c d
    structural type NeedsA a b
    f  : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
    f2 : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
    f3 : NeedsA Nat Nat -> Nat
    g  : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
scratch/a> branch /a2

  Done. I've created the a2 branch based off of a.

  Tip: To merge your work back into the a branch, first
       `switch /a` then `merge /a2`.
```

First let's edit the `A` type, adding another constructor `E`. Note that the functions written against the old type have a wildcard in their pattern match, so they should work fine after the update.

``` unison :hide
unique type A a b c d
  = A a
  | B b
  | C c
  | D d
  | E a d
```

Let's do the update now, and verify that the definitions all look good and there's nothing `todo`:

``` ucm
scratch/a2> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  Everything typechecks, so I'm saving the results...

  Done.
scratch/a2> view A NeedsA f f2 f3 g

  type A a b c d
    = A a
    | D d
    | E a d
    | B b
    | C c

  structural type NeedsA a b
    = NeedsA (A a b Nat Nat)

  f : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
  f = cases

    _   -> 42

  f2 : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
  f2 a =
    use Nat +
    n = f a
    n + 1

  f3 : NeedsA Nat Nat -> Nat
  f3 = cases
    NeedsA a -> f a Nat.+ 20
    _        -> 0

  g : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
  g = cases
    D n -> n

  You have no pending todo items. Good work! ✅

## Record updates

Here's a test of updating a record:

``` ucm :hide
scratch/r1> builtins.merge lib.builtins
```

``` unison
structural type Rec = { uno : Nat, dos : Nat }

combine r = uno r + dos r
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      structural type Rec
      Rec.dos        : Rec -> Nat
      Rec.dos.modify : (Nat ->{g} Nat) -> Rec ->{g} Rec
      Rec.dos.set    : Nat -> Rec -> Rec
      Rec.uno        : Rec -> Nat
      Rec.uno.modify : (Nat ->{g} Nat) -> Rec ->{g} Rec
      Rec.uno.set    : Nat -> Rec -> Rec
      combine        : Rec -> Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/r1> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    structural type Rec
    Rec.dos        : Rec -> Nat
    Rec.dos.modify : (Nat ->{g} Nat) -> Rec ->{g} Rec
    Rec.dos.set    : Nat -> Rec -> Rec
    Rec.uno        : Rec -> Nat
    Rec.uno.modify : (Nat ->{g} Nat) -> Rec ->{g} Rec
    Rec.uno.set    : Nat -> Rec -> Rec
    combine        : Rec -> Nat
scratch/r1> branch r2

  Done. I've created the r2 branch based off of r1.

  Tip: To merge your work back into the r1 branch, first
       `switch /r1` then `merge /r2`.
```

``` unison
structural type Rec = { uno : Nat, dos : Nat, tres : Text }
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      Rec.tres        : Rec -> Text
      Rec.tres.modify : (Text ->{g} Text) -> Rec ->{g} Rec
      Rec.tres.set    : Text -> Rec -> Rec
    
    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      structural type Rec
      Rec.dos        : Rec -> Nat
      Rec.dos.modify : (Nat ->{g} Nat) -> Rec ->{g} Rec
      Rec.dos.set    : Nat -> Rec -> Rec
      Rec.uno        : Rec -> Nat
      Rec.uno.modify : (Nat ->{g} Nat) -> Rec ->{g} Rec
      Rec.uno.set    : Nat -> Rec -> Rec
```

And checking that after updating this record, there's nothing `todo`:

``` ucm
scratch/r2> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  Everything typechecks, so I'm saving the results...

  Done.
