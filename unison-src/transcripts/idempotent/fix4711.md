  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      thisDoesNotWork : ['{g} Int]
      thisWorks       : 'Int
```

Since this is fixed, `thisDoesNotWork` now does work.

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    thisDoesNotWork : ['{g} Int]
    thisWorks       : 'Int
scratch/main> edit thisWorks thisDoesNotWork

  ☝️

  I added 2 definitions to the top of scratch.u

  You can edit them there, then run `update` to replace the
  definitions currently in this namespace.
scratch/main> load

  I found and typechecked the definitions in scratch.u. This
  file has been previously added to the codebase.
```

``` unison :added-by-ucm scratch.u
thisDoesNotWork : ['{g} Int]
thisDoesNotWork = [do +1]

thisWorks : 'Int
thisWorks = do +1
```
