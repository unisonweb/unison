# Example 1

We have a namespace type named `Namespace.Foo` and a file type named `File.Foo`. A reference to the type `Foo` is
ambiguous. A reference to `Namespace.Foo` or `File.Foo` work fine.

``` ucm
scratch/main> builtins.mergeio lib.builtins

  Done.
```

``` unison
type Namespace.Foo = Bar
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      type Namespace.Foo
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    type Namespace.Foo

type UsesFoo = UsesFoo Foo

# Example 2

We have a namespace type named `Foo` and a file type named `File.Foo`. A reference to the type `Foo` is not ambiguous:
it refers to the namespace type (because it is an exact match).

  The name foo is ambiguous. Its type should be: Nat

  I found some terms in scope that have matching names and
  types. Maybe you meant one of these:

  file.foo : Nat
  ns.foo : Nat
