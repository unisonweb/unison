Tests a variable capture problem.

After pattern compilation, the match would end up:

``` 
T p1 p3 p3
```

and z would end up referring to the first p3 rather than the second.

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.merge
```

``` unison
structural type Trip = T Nat Nat Nat

bad : Nat -> (Nat, Nat)
bad x = match Some (Some x) with
  Some (Some x) -> match T 3 4 5 with
    T _ _ z -> (x, z)
  _ -> (0,0)

> bad 2
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      structural type Trip
      bad : Nat -> (Nat, Nat)

  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

    9 | > bad 2
          ⧩
          (2, 5)
```
