  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      structural type M a
        (also named builtin.Optional)
      d : Doc2
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    structural type M a
      (also named builtin.Optional)
    d : Doc2
scratch/main> display d

  `x -> J x`

  J
```
