This transcript demonstrates that dependents of an upgrade are suffixified properly. Previously, `c = b.y + 1` would
render as `c = y + 1` (ambiguous).

``` ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin

  Done.
```

``` unison
lib.old.x = 17
lib.new.x = 100

a.y = 18
b.y = lib.old.x + 1

c = b.y + 1
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      a.y       : Nat
      b.y       : Nat
      c         : Nat
      lib.new.x : Nat
      lib.old.x : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    a.y       : Nat
    b.y       : Nat
    c         : Nat
    lib.new.x : Nat
    lib.old.x : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> upgrade old new

  I upgraded old to new, and removed old.
```
