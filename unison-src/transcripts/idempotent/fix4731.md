  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      structural type Void
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    structural type Void
```

We should be able to `match` on empty types like `Void`.

``` unison
Void.absurdly : '{e} Void ->{e} a
Void.absurdly v = match !v with
```

And empty `cases` should also work.

Void.absurdly = cases
```

But empty function bodies are not allowed.

Void.absurd x =

  I expected a block after this (in red), but there wasn't one.  Maybe check your indentation:
      2 | Void.absurd x =
```
