  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      lib.foo0.baz           : Nat
      lib.foo0.lib.bonk1.bar : Nat
      lib.foo1.lib.bonk2.qux : Nat
      lib.foo1.zonk          : Nat
      mybar                  : Nat
```

``` ucm :error
myproj/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    lib.foo0.baz           : Nat
    lib.foo0.lib.bonk1.bar : Nat
    lib.foo1.lib.bonk2.qux : Nat
    lib.foo1.zonk          : Nat
    mybar                  : Nat
myproj/main> upgrade foo0 foo1

  I couldn't automatically upgrade foo0 to foo1. However, I've
  added the definitions that need attention to the top of
  scratch.u.

  When you're done, you can run

    upgrade.commit

  to merge your changes back into main and delete the temporary
  branch. Or, if you decide to cancel the upgrade instead, you
  can run

    delete.branch /upgrade-foo0-to-foo1

  to delete the temporary branch and switch back to main.
```

``` unison :added-by-ucm scratch.u
mybar : Nat
mybar =
  use Nat +
  use lib.foo0.lib.bonk1 bar
  bar + bar
```
