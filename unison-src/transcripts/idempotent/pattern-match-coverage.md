  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  Patterns not matched:

## redundant patterns

```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

# Uninhabited patterns

``` unison

  change:

uninhabited patterns are reported as redundant

## Exhaustive

## Non-exhaustive

  Patterns not matched:
   * (() +: (() +: _))
```

## Uninhabited

`Cons` is not expected since `V` is uninhabited

``` unison
unique type V =

test : [V] -> ()
test = cases
  [] -> ()
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      type V
      test : [V] -> ()
```

## Length restrictions can equate cons and nil patterns

Here the first pattern matches lists of length two or greater, the
second pattern matches lists of length 0. The third case matches when the
final element is `false`, while the fourth pattern matches when the
first element is `true`. However, the only possible list length at
the third or fourth clause is 1, so the first and final element must
be equal. Thus, the pattern match is exhaustive.

``` unison
test : [Boolean] -> ()
test = cases
  [a, b] ++ xs -> ()
  [] -> ()
  xs :+ false -> ()
  true +: xs -> ()
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      test : [Boolean] -> ()
```

This is the same idea as above but shows that fourth match is redundant.

``` unison :error
test : [Boolean] -> ()
test = cases
  [a, b] ++ xs -> ()
  [] -> ()
  xs :+ true -> ()
  true +: xs -> ()
  _ -> ()
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  This case would be ignored because it's already covered by the preceding case(s):
        6 |   true +: xs -> ()
    
```

This is another similar example. The first pattern matches lists of
length 5 or greater. The second matches lists of length 4 or greater where the
first and third element are true. The third matches lists of length 4
or greater where the final 4 elements are `true, false, true, false`.
The list must be exactly of length 4 to arrive at the second or third
clause, so the third pattern is redundant.

``` unison :error
test : [Boolean] -> ()
test = cases
  [a, b, c, d, f] ++ xs -> ()
  [true, _, true, _] ++ _ -> ()
  _ ++ [true, false, true, false] -> ()
  _ -> ()
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  This case would be ignored because it's already covered by the preceding case(s):
        5 |   _ ++ [true, false, true, false] -> ()
    
```

# bugfix: Sufficient data decl map

``` unison
unique type T = A

unit2t : Unit -> T
unit2t = cases
  () -> A
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

      type T
      unit2t : 'T
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    type T
    unit2t : 'T
```

Pattern coverage checking needs the data decl map to contain all
transitive type dependencies of the scrutinee type. We do this
before typechecking begins in a roundabout way: fetching all
transitive type dependencies of references that appear in the expression.

This test ensures that we have fetched the `T` type although there is
no data decl reference to `T` in `witht`.

        8 |        { x } -> x

## Hacky workaround for uninhabited abilities

Although all of the constructors of an ability might be uninhabited,
the typechecker requires at least one be specified so that it can
determine that the ability should be discharged. So, the default
pattern match coverage checking behavior of prohibiting covering any
of the cases is problematic. Instead, the pattern match coverage
checker will require that at least one constructor be given, even if
they are all uninhabited.

The messages here aren't the best, but I don't think uninhabited
abilities will come up and get handlers written for them often.
