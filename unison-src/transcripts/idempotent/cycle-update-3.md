Update a member of a cycle with a type-changing update, thus severing the cycle.

``` unison

  + pong : 'Nat

  Run `update` to apply these changes to your codebase.
```

``` ucm

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  Done.
```

``` unison
ping : Nat
ping = 3

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  updated...

  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  Some definitions don't typecheck with your changes. I've
  update the file scratch.u with the definitions that need
  fixing. Once the file is compiling, try `update` again.

  I've also switched you to a new branch update-main for this
  work. On `update`, it will be merged back into main.
```

``` unison :added-by-ucm scratch.u
ping : Nat
ping = 3

-- The definitions below no longer typecheck with the changes above.
-- Please fix the errors and try `update` again.

pong : 'Nat
pong _ =
  use Nat +
  ping() + 2

```
