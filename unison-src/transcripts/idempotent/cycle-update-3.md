  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      ping : 'Nat
      pong : 'Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    ping : 'Nat
    pong : 'Nat
```

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you

    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      ping : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> update.old

  ⍟ I've updated these names to your new definition:

    ping : Nat
scratch/main> view ping pong

  ping : Nat
  ping = 3

  pong : 'Nat
  pong _ =
    use Nat +
    #4t465jk908.1() + 2
