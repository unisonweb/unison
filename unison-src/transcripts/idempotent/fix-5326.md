scratch/main> branch foo

  Done. I've created the foo branch based off of main.

  Tip: To merge your work back into the main branch, first
       `switch /main` then `merge /foo`.

``` 
main

          E
          |
          foo
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> merge /foo

  I merged scratch/foo into scratch/main.
```

``` 
main
|
|           bar
|           |
F - D - C - B - A
 \             /
  ----------- E
              |
              foo
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> merge /bar

  😶

  scratch/main was already up-to-date with scratch/bar.
```

This should be a fast-forward, but we used to get this shape instead (which fails due to conflicts), because we
incorrectly computed `LCA(main, bar)` as `A`, not `B`.

``` 
main
|
|  ------------ bar
| /            \|
G - F - D - C - B - A
     \             /
      ----------- E
                  |
                  foo
```
