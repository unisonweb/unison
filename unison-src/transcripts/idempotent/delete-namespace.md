# delete.namespace.force

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.merge
```

``` unison :hide
no_dependencies.thing = "no dependents on this term"

dependencies.term1 = 1
dependencies.term2 = 2

dependents.usage1 = dependencies.term1 + dependencies.term2
dependents.usage2 = dependencies.term1 * dependencies.term2
```

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> add
```

Deleting a namespace with no external dependencies should succeed.

``` ucm
scratch/main> delete.namespace no_dependencies

  Done.
```

Deleting a namespace with external dependencies should fail and list all dependents.

``` ucm :error
scratch/main> delete.namespace dependencies

  ⚠️

  I didn't delete the namespace because the following
  definitions are still in use.

  Dependency   Referenced In
  term2        1. dependents.usage1
               2. dependents.usage2
               
  term1        3. dependents.usage1
               4. dependents.usage2

  If you want to proceed anyways and leave those definitions
  without names, use delete.namespace.force
```

Deleting a namespace with external dependencies should succeed when using `delete.namespace.force`

``` ucm
scratch/main> delete.namespace.force dependencies

  Done.

  ⚠️

  Of the things I deleted, the following are still used in the
  following definitions. They now contain un-named references.

  Dependency   Referenced In
  term2        1. dependents.usage1
               2. dependents.usage2
               
  term1        3. dependents.usage1
               4. dependents.usage2
```

I should be able to view an affected dependency by number

``` ucm
scratch/main> view 2

  dependents.usage2 : Nat
  dependents.usage2 =
    use Nat *
    #gjmq673r1v * #dcgdua2lj6
```

Deleting the root namespace should require confirmation if not forced.

``` ucm
scratch/main> delete.namespace .

  ⚠️

  Are you sure you want to clear away everything?
  You could use `project.create` to switch to a new project
  instead, or delete the current branch with `delete.branch`
scratch/main> delete.namespace .

  Okay, I deleted everything except the history. Use `undo` to
  undo, or `builtins.merge` to restore the absolute basics to
  the current path.
-- Should have an empty history
scratch/main> history .

  Note: The most recent namespace hash is immediately below this
        message.
