This transcript demonstrates that dependents of an update are suffixified properly. Previously, `c = b.y + 1` would
render as `c = y + 1` (ambiguous).

``` ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin

  Done.
```

``` unison
x = 17

a.y = 18
b.y = x + 1

c = b.y + 1
```

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      a.y : Nat
      b.y : Nat
      c   : Nat
      x   : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    a.y : Nat
    b.y : Nat
    c   : Nat
    x   : Nat
```

``` unison
x = 100

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      x : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  Everything typechecks, so I'm saving the results...

  Done.
