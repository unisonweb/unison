  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      bar                         : Nat
      lib.direct.foo              : Nat
      lib.direct.lib.indirect.foo : Nat
```

Here, `bar` renders as `foo + foo`, even though there are two names with suffix `foo` in scope, because one is an
indirect dependency. It used to render as `direct.foo + direct.foo`.

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    bar                         : Nat
    lib.direct.foo              : Nat
    lib.direct.lib.indirect.foo : Nat
scratch/main> view bar

  bar : Nat
  bar =
    use Nat +
    foo + foo
```

Same test, but for types.

``` unison
type lib.direct.Foo = MkFoo
type lib.direct.lib.indirect.Foo = MkFoo

type Bar = MkBar direct.Foo
```
