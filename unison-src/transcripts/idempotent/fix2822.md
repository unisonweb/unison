# Inability to reference a term or type with a name that has segments starting with an underscore

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.mergeio
```

There should be no issue having terms with an underscore-led component

``` unison
_a.blah = 2

b = _a.blah + 1
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      _a.blah : Nat
      b       : Nat
```

Or even that *are* a single “blank” component

``` unison
_b = 2

x = _b + 1
```

      _b : Nat
      x  : Nat
```

Types can also have underscore-led components.

``` unison
unique type _a.Blah = A

c : _a.Blah
c = A
```

      type _a.Blah
      c : Blah
```

And we should also be able to access underscore-led fields.

``` unison
type Hello = {_value : Nat}

doStuff = _value.modify
```

      Hello._value        : Hello -> Nat
      Hello._value.modify : (Nat ->{g} Nat) -> Hello ->{g} Hello
      Hello._value.set    : Nat -> Hello -> Hello
      doStuff             : (Nat ->{g} Nat) -> Hello ->{g} Hello
```

But pattern matching shouldn’t bind to underscore-led names.

``` unison :error
dontMap f = cases
  None -> false
  Some _used -> f _used
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I couldn't figure out what _used refers to here:

      3 |   Some _used -> f _used

  I also don't know what type it should be.

  Some common causes of this error include:
    * Your current namespace is too deep to contain the
      definition in its subtree
    * The definition is part of a library which hasn't been
      added to this project
    * You have a typo in the name
```

But we can use them as unbound patterns.

``` unison
dontMap f = cases
  None -> false
  Some _unused -> f 2
```

```
