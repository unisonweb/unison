  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      doc : Doc2
```

And round-trips properly.

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    doc : Doc2
scratch/main> edit doc

  ☝️

  I added 1 definitions to the top of scratch.u

  You can edit them there, then run `update` to replace the
  definitions currently in this namespace.
scratch/main> load scratch.u
