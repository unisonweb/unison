``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.mergeio
```

``` unison :hide
test> foo : [Test.Result]
foo = []
```

Apparently when we add a test watch, we add a type annotation to it, even if it already has one. We don't want this to happen though\!

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    foo : [Result]
scratch/main> view foo

  foo : [Result]
  foo : [Result]
  foo = []
```
