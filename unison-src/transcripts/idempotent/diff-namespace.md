Things we want to test:

  - Diffing identical namespaces
  - Adds, removes, updates
      - Adds with multiple names
  - Moved and copied definitions
      - Moves that have more that 1 initial or final name
  - ... terms and types
  - New patches, modified patches, deleted patches, moved patches
  - With and without propagated updates

## Display issues to fixup

  - \[d\] Do we want to surface new edit conflicts in patches?
  - \[t\] two different auto-propagated changes creating a name conflict should show
    up somewhere besides the auto-propagate count
  - \[t\] Things look screwy when the type signature doesn't fit and has to get broken
    up into multiple lines. Maybe just disallow that?
  - \[d\] Delete blank line in between copies / renames entries if all entries are 1 to 1
    see todo in the code
  - \[x\] incorrectly calculated bracket alignment on hashqualified "Name changes"  (delete.output.md)
  - \[x\] just handle deletion of isPropagated in propagate function, leave HandleInput alone (assuming this does the trick)
  - \[x\] might want unqualified names to be qualified sometimes:
  - \[x\] if a name is updated to a not-yet-named reference, it's shown as both an update and an add
  - \[x\] similarly, if a conflicted name is resolved by deleting the last name to
    a reference, I (arya) suspect it will show up as a Remove
  - \[d\] Maybe group and/or add headings to the types, constructors, terms
  - \[x\] add tagging of propagated updates to test propagated updates output
  - \[x\] missing old names in deletion ppe (delete.output.md)  (superseded by \#1143)
  - \[x\] delete.term has some bonkers output
  - \[x\] Make a decision about how we want to show constructors in the diff
  - \[x\] 12.patch patch needs a space
  - \[x\] This looks like garbage
  - \[x\] Extra 2 blank lines at the end of the add section
  - \[x\] Fix alignment issues with buildTable, convert to column3M (to be written)
  - \[x\] adding an alias is showing up as an Add and a Copy; should just show as Copy
  - \[x\] removing one of multiple aliases appears in removes + moves + copies section
  - \[x\] some overlapping cases between Moves and Copies^
  - \[x\] Maybe don't list the type signature twice for aliases?
