  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      type lib.dep.lib.dep.Foo
      type my.Foo
      lib.dep.lib.dep.foo : Nat
      my.foo              : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    type lib.dep.lib.dep.Foo
    type my.Foo
    lib.dep.lib.dep.foo : Nat
    my.foo              : Nat
```

These references to type `Foo` and term `foo` are unambiguous (resolving to the `my.Foo` and `my.foo` in the
file), even though indirect dependencies `lib.dep.lib.dep.Foo` and `lib.dep.lib.dep.foo` match by suffix.

``` unison
type my.Foo = MkFoo
type Bar = MkBar Foo
```
