scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    lib.dep.lib.bad.foo  : Text
    lib.dep.lib.good.foo : Nat
```

``` unison
thing = foo Nat.+ foo
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      thing : Nat
```

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> delete.project scratch
```
