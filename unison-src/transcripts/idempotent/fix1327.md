  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      bar : ##Nat
      foo : ##Nat
```

`alias.many` should be able to consume the numbered args produced by `ls`. Previously, `ls` would produce absolute paths, but `alias.many` required relative ones.

Now `ls` returns a pair of the absolute search directory and the result relative to that search directory, so it can be used in both absolute and relative contexts.

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    bar : ##Nat
    foo : ##Nat
scratch/main> ls

  1. bar (##Nat)
  2. foo (##Nat)
scratch/main> alias.many 1-2 .ns1_nohistory

  Here's what changed in .ns1_nohistory :

  Added definitions:

    1. bar : ##Nat
    2. foo : ##Nat

  Tip: You can use `undo` or use a hash from `reflog` to undo
       this change.
