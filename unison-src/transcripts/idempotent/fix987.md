``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.merge
```

First we'll add a definition:

``` unison
structural ability DeathStar where
  attack : Text -> ()

spaceAttack1 x =
  y = attack "saturn"
  z = attack "neptune"
  "All done"
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      structural ability DeathStar
      spaceAttack1 : x ->{DeathStar} Text
```

Add it to the codebase:

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    structural ability DeathStar
    spaceAttack1 : x ->{DeathStar} Text
```

Now we'll try to add a different definition that runs the actions in a different order. This should work fine:

``` unison
spaceAttack2 x =
  z = attack "neptune"
  y = attack "saturn"
  "All done"
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

Previously, this would fail because the hashing algorithm was being given one big let rec block whose binding order was normalized.
