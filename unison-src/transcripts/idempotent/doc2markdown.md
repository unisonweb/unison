You can add docs to a term or type with a top-level doc literal above the binding:

``` unison
{{ This is a term doc }}
myTerm = 10

-- Regression tests for https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/issues/4634
{{ This is a type doc }}
type MyType = MyType

{{ This is a unique type doc }}
unique type MyUniqueType = MyUniqueType

{{ This is a structural type doc }}
structural type MyStructuralType = MyStructuralType
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      structural type MyStructuralType
        (also named builtin.Unit)
      type MyType
      type MyUniqueType
      MyStructuralType.doc : Doc2
      MyType.doc           : Doc2
      MyUniqueType.doc     : Doc2
      myTerm               : Nat
      myTerm.doc           : Doc2
```
