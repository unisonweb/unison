  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      type Bar
      type Baz
      type Foo
      useBar : Bar -> Nat
```

``` ucm
myproject/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    type Bar
    type Baz
    type Foo
    useBar : Bar -> Nat
```

``` unison
unique type Foo = Foo1 | Foo2

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you

    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      type Foo
```

``` ucm
myproject/main> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  Everything typechecks, so I'm saving the results...

  Done.
