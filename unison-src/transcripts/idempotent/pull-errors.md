  I installed @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main as
  aryairani_test_almost_empty_main.
test/main> pull @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main a.b

  ⚠️

  Sorry, I wasn’t sure how to process your request:

    I think you want to merge @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main
    into the a.b namespace, but the `pull` command only supports
    merging into the top level of a local project branch.

  You can run `help pull` for more information on using `pull`.
test/main> pull @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main a

  I think you want to merge @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main
  into the a branch, but it doesn't exist. If you want, you can
  create it with `branch.empty a`, and then `pull` again.
test/main> pull @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main .a
