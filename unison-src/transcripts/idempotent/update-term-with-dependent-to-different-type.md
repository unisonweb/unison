  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  Some definitions don't typecheck with your changes. I've
  update the file scratch.u with the definitions that need
  fixing. Once the file is compiling, try `update` again.

  I've also switched you to a new branch update-main for this
  work. On `update`, it will be merged back into main.
```

``` unison :added-by-ucm scratch.u
foo : Int
foo = +5

-- The definitions below no longer typecheck with the changes above.
-- Please fix the errors and try `update` again.

bar : Nat
bar =
  use Nat +
  foo + 10

```
