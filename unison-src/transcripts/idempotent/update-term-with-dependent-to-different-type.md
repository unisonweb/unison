  That's done. Some of that code uses a type that changed, so
  I'm typechecking those parts again...

  I couldn't complete the update, because some existing
  definitions would no longer typecheck.

  You're now on a temporary branch, update-main, and the
  definitions to fix are in update-main-57d67278.u.

  Edit the file, then run:

      scratch/update-main> load update-main-57d67278.u

  If `load` reports errors, fix them and run it again. When the
  file loads with no errors, run:

      scratch/update-main> update

  `update` saves the file's definitions into main, removes any
  definitions you deleted from the file, and deletes the
  temporary branch. To abandon the update instead, run `cancel`.

  Note: Definitions listed in the file don't exist in the branch
  until a successful `update`.
```

``` unison :added-by-ucm update-main-57d67278.u
foo : Int
foo = +5

-- The definitions below no longer typecheck with the changes above.
-- Please fix the errors and try `update` again.

bar : Nat
bar =
  use Nat +
  foo + 10

```
