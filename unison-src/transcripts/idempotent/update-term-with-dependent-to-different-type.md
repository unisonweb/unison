  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  I couldn't complete the update, because some existing
  definitions would no longer typecheck.

  I've created a temporary branch and added the affected
  definitions to scratch.u, where you can fix them up or remove
  any that are obsolete.

  Once you're happy with the results, use`update`to merge them back intomain,or`cancel`if you change your mind.
```

``` unison :added-by-ucm scratch.u
foo : Int
foo = +5

-- The definitions below no longer typecheck with the changes above.
-- Please fix the errors and try `update` again.

bar : Nat
bar =
  use Nat +
  foo + 10

```
