# Documenting Unison code

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtins
```

Unison documentation is written in Unison. Documentation is a value of the following type:

``` ucm
scratch/main> view lib.builtins.Doc

  type lib.builtins.Doc
    = Blob Text
    | Link Link
    | Source Link
    | Signature Term
    | Evaluate Term
    | Join [lib.builtins.Doc]
```

You can create these `Doc` values with ordinary code, or you can use the special syntax. A value of structural type `Doc` can be created via syntax like:

``` unison
doc1 = [: This is some documentation.

It can span multiple lines.

Can link to definitions like @List.drop or @List

:]
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      doc1 : Doc
```

Syntax:

`[:` starts a documentation block; `:]` finishes it. Within the block:

  - Links to definitions are done with `@List`. `\@` (and `\:]`) if you want to escape.
  - `@[signature] List.take` expands to the type signature of `List.take`
  - `@[source] List.map` expands to the full source of `List.map`
  - `@[include] someOtherDoc`, inserts a value `someOtherDoc : Doc` here.
  - `@[evaluate] someDefinition` expands to the result of evaluating `someDefinition`, which must be a pre-existing definition in the codebase (can't be an arbitrary expression).

### An example

We are going to document `List.take` using some verbiage and a few examples. First we have to add the examples to the codebase:

``` unison
List.take.ex1 = take 0 [1,2,3,4,5]
List.take.ex2 = take 2 [1,2,3,4,5]
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      List.take.ex1 : [Nat]
      List.take.ex2 : [Nat]
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    List.take.ex1 : [Nat]
    List.take.ex2 : [Nat]
```

And now let's write our docs and reference these examples:

``` unison
List.take.doc = [:
`@List.take n xs` returns the first `n` elements of `xs`. (No need to add line breaks manually. The display command will do wrapping of text for you.  Indent any lines where you don't want it to do this.)

## Examples:

  @[source] List.take.ex1
  🔽
  @List.take.ex1 = @[evaluate] List.take.ex1


  @[source] List.take.ex2
  🔽
  @List.take.ex2 = @[evaluate] List.take.ex2
:]
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      List.take.doc : Doc
```

Let's add it to the codebase.

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    List.take.doc : Doc
```

We can view it with `docs`, which shows the `Doc` value that is associated with a definition.

``` ucm
scratch/main> docs List.take

  `List.take n xs` returns the first `n` elements of `xs`. (No 
  need to add line breaks manually. The display command will do 
  wrapping of text for you.  Indent any lines where you don't 
  want it to do this.)

  ## Examples:

    List.take.ex1 : [Nat]
  List.take.ex1 = List.take 0 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    🔽
    ex1 = []


    List.take.ex2 : [Nat]
  List.take.ex2 = List.take 2 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    🔽
    ex2 = [1, 2]
```

Note that if we view the source of the documentation, the various references are *not* expanded.

``` ucm
scratch/main> view List.take

  builtin lib.builtins.List.take :
    lib.builtins.Nat -> [a] -> [a]
```
