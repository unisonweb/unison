  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      hangExample : Boolean
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    hangExample : Boolean
scratch/main> view hangExample

  hangExample : Boolean
  hangExample =
    "a long piece of text to hang the line" == ""
      && "a long piece of text to hang the line" == ""
```
