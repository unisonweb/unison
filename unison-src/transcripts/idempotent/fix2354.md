Tests that delaying an un-annotated higher-rank type gives a normal
type error, rather than an internal compiler error.

``` unison :error
f : (forall a . a -> a) -> Nat
f id = id 0

x = 'f
```

  I found a value  of type:  (a1 ->{𝕖} a1) ->{𝕖} Nat
  where I expected to find:  (a -> 𝕣1) -> 𝕣

      1 | f : (forall a . a -> a) -> Nat
      2 | f id = id 0
      3 | 
      4 | x = 'f

    from right here:

      1 | f : (forall a . a -> a) -> Nat
```
