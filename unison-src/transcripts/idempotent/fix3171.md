Tests an case where decompiling could cause function arguments to occur in the
opposite order for partially applied functions.

``` unison
f : Nat -> Nat -> Nat -> () -> Nat
f x y z _ = x + y * z

> f 1 2
> f 1 2 3
```

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      f : Nat -> Nat -> Nat -> 'Nat

  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

    4 | > f 1 2
          ⧩
          z _ -> 1 Nat.+ 2 Nat.* z

    5 | > f 1 2 3
          ⧩
          _ -> 1 Nat.+ 2 Nat.* 3
```
