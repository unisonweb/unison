  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      bar : Nat
      foo : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    bar : Nat

``` ucm
scratch/main> update

  Everything typechecks, so I'm saving the results...

  Done.
