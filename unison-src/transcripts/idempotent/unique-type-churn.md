This transcript demonstrates that unique types no longer always get a fresh GUID: they share GUIDs with already-saved
unique types of the same name.

``` unison
unique type A = A

unique type B = B C
unique type C = C B
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      type A
      type B
      type C
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    type A
    type B
    type C
```

``` unison
unique type A = A

unique type B = B C
unique type C = C B
```

  I found and typechecked the definitions in scratch.u. This
  file has been previously added to the codebase.

If the name stays the same, the churn is even prevented if the type is updated and then reverted to the original form.

``` ucm
scratch/main> names A

  Type
  Hash:  #uj8oalgadr
  Names: A

  Term
  Hash:   #uj8oalgadr#0
  Names:  A.A
```

``` unison
unique type A = A ()
```

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      type A
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  Done.
scratch/main> names A

  Type
  Hash:  #ufo5tuc7ho
  Names: A

  Term
  Hash:   #ufo5tuc7ho#0
  Names:  A.A
```

``` unison
unique type A = A
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

Note that `A` is back to its original hash.

  Done.
