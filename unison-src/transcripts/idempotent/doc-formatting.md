This transcript explains a few minor details about doc parsing and pretty-printing, both from a user point of view and with some implementation notes.  The later stuff is meant more as unit testing than for human consumption.  (The ucm `add` commands and their output are hidden for brevity.)

Docs can be used as inline code comments.

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.merge
```

``` unison
foo : Nat -> Nat
foo n =
  _ = [: do the thing :]
  n + 1
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      foo : Nat -> Nat
```

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> add
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> view foo

  foo : Nat -> Nat
  foo n =
    use Nat +
    _ = [: do the thing :]
    n + 1
```

Note that `@` and `:]` must be escaped within docs.

``` unison
escaping = [: Docs look [: like \@this \:] :]
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      escaping : Doc
```

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> add
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> view escaping

  escaping : Doc
  escaping = [: Docs look [: like \@this \:] :]
```

(Alas you can't have `\@` or `\:]` in your doc, as there's currently no way to 'unescape' them.)

``` unison
-- Note that -- comments are preserved within doc literals.
commented = [:
  example:

    -- a comment
    f x = x + 1
:]
```

```

scratch/main> add
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> view commented

  commented : Doc
  commented =
    [: example:
    
    -- a comment f x = x + 1
     :]
```

### Indenting, and paragraph reflow

Handling of indenting in docs between the parser and pretty-printer is a bit fiddly.

``` unison
-- The leading and trailing spaces are stripped from the stored Doc by the
-- lexer, and one leading and trailing space is inserted again on view/edit
-- by the pretty-printer.
doc1 = [:   hi   :]
```

      doc1 : Doc
```

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> add
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> view doc1

  doc1 : Doc
  doc1 = [: hi :]
```

``` unison
-- Lines (apart from the first line, i.e. the bit between the [: and the
-- first newline) are unindented until at least one of
-- them hits the left margin (by a post-processing step in the parser).
-- You may not notice this because the pretty-printer indents them again on
-- view/edit.
doc2 = [: hello
            - foo
            - bar
          and the rest. :]
```

doc3 = [: When Unison identifies a paragraph, it removes any newlines from it before storing it, and then reflows the paragraph text to fit the display window on display/view/edit.

For these purposes, a paragraph is any sequence of non-empty lines that have zero indent (after the unindenting mentioned above.)

 - So this is not a paragraph, even
   though you might want it to be.

   And this text  | as a paragraph
   is not treated | either.

Note that because of the special treatment of the first line mentioned above, where its leading space is removed, it is always treated as a paragraph.
