Formatter should leave things alone if the file doesn't typecheck.

``` unison :error
brokenDoc = {{ hello }} + 1
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I couldn't figure out what + refers to here:

      1 | brokenDoc = {{ hello }} + 1

  The name + is ambiguous. I tried to resolve it by type but no
  term with that name would pass typechecking. I think its type
  should be:

      Doc2 -> Nat -> o

  If that's not what you expected, you may have a type error
  somewhere else in your code.
  Help me out by using a more specific name here or adding a
  type annotation.

  I found some terms in scope with matching names but different 
  types. If one of these is what you meant, try using its full 
  name:

  (Float.+) : Float -> Float -> Float
  (Int.+) : Int -> Int -> Int
  (Nat.+) : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
