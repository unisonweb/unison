  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      allowDebug : Text
      bool       : Boolean
      debug      : a -> Text
      t1         : [Result]

  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

    6 | test> t1 = if bool then [Ok "Yay"]
    
    ✅ Passed Yay
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    allowDebug : Text
    bool       : Boolean
    debug      : a -> Text
    t1         : [Result]
scratch/main> test

  Cached test results (`help testcache` to learn more)

    1. t1   ◉ Yay

  ✅ 1 test(s) passing

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you

    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      bool : Boolean
```

``` ucm :error

  ⍟ I've updated these names to your new definition:

  ✅
