Tests for an ability failure that was caused by order dependence of
checking wanted vs. provided abilities. It was necessary to re-check
rows until a fixed point is reached.

``` ucm :hide

``` unison
unique ability C c where
  new : c a
  receive : c a -> a
  send : a -> c a -> ()

unique ability A t g where
  fork : '{A t g, g, Exception} a -> t a
  await : t a -> a

unique ability Ex where raise : () -> x

Ex.catch : '{Ex, g} a ->{g} Either () a
Ex.catch _ = todo "Exception.catch"

C.pure.run : (forall c . '{C c, g} r) ->{Ex, g} r
C.pure.run _ = todo "C.pure.run"

A.pure.run : (forall t . '{A t g, g} a) ->{Ex,g} a
A.pure.run _ = todo "A.pure.run"

ex : '{C c, A t {C c}} Nat
ex _ =
  c = C.new
  x = A.fork 'let
    a = receive c
    a + 10

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      ability A t g
      ability C c
      ability Ex
      A.pure.run : (∀ t. '{g, A t g} a) ->{g, Ex} a
      C.pure.run : (∀ c. '{g, C c} r) ->{g, Ex} r
      Ex.catch   : '{g, Ex} a ->{g} Either () a
      ex         : '{C c, A t {C c}} Nat
      x          : 'Either () Nat
```
