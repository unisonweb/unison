``` ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge

  Done.
```

First, lets create two namespaces. `foo` and `bar`, and add some definitions.

``` unison
foo.x = 42
foo.y = 100
bar.z = x + y
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      bar.z : Nat
      foo.x : Nat
      foo.y : Nat
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    bar.z : Nat
    foo.x : Nat
    foo.y : Nat
```

Let's see what we have created...

``` ucm
scratch/main> ls

  1. bar/     (1 term)
  2. builtin/ (469 terms, 74 types)
  3. foo/     (2 terms)
```

Now, if we try deleting the namespace `foo`, we get an error, as expected.

``` ucm :error
scratch/main> delete.namespace foo

  ⚠️

  I didn't delete the namespace because the following
  definitions are still in use.

  Dependency   Referenced In
  x            1. bar.z
               
  y            2. bar.z

  If you want to proceed anyways and leave those definitions
  without names, use delete.namespace.force
```

Any numbered arguments should refer to `bar.z`.

``` ucm
scratch/main> debug.numberedArgs

  1. bar.z
  2. bar.z
```

We can then delete the dependent term, and then delete `foo`.

``` ucm
scratch/main> delete.term 1

  Done.
scratch/main> delete.namespace foo

  Done.
```
