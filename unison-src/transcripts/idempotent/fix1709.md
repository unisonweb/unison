  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      id  : x -> x
      id2 : x -> x
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add

    id  : x -> x
    id2 : x -> x
```

``` unison
> id2 "hi"
```
