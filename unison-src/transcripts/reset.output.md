foo/main> history

  ☝️  The namespace  is empty.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:

```
```ucm
foo/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    a : ##Nat

foo/main> branch topic

  Done. I've created the topic branch based off of main.
  
  Tip: Use `merge /topic /main` to merge your work back into the
       main branch.

foo/main> reset 2 main

  I'm not sure if you wanted to reset the branch foo/main or the
  namespace main in the current branch. Could you be more
  specific?
  
  1. /main (the branch main in the current project)
  2. main (the relative path main in the current branch)
  
  Tip: use `reset <some hash> 1` or `reset <some hash> 2` to
       pick one of these.

```
## ambiguous hash

```unison
main.a = 3
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked the definitions in scratch.u. This
  file has been previously added to the codebase.

```
```ucm
foo/main> switch /topic

foo/topic> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    main.a : ##Nat

foo/topic> reset main

  I'm not sure if you wanted to reset to the branch foo/main or
  to the namespace main in the current branch. Could you be more
  specific?
  
  1. /main (the branch main in the current project)
  2. main (the relative path main in the current branch)
  
  Tip: use `reset 1` or `reset 2` to pick one of these.

```
