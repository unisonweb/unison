  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      structural type M a
        (also named builtin.Optional)
      d : Doc2

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    structural type M a
      (also named builtin.Optional)
    d : Doc2

.> display d

  `x -> J x`
  
  J

```
