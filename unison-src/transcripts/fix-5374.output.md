``` ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin

  Done.

```
``` unison
lib.direct.foo = 17
lib.direct.lib.indirect.foo = 18

thing = indirect.foo + indirect.foo
```

``` ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      lib.direct.foo              : Nat
      lib.direct.lib.indirect.foo : Nat
      thing                       : Nat

```
``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    lib.direct.foo              : Nat
    lib.direct.lib.indirect.foo : Nat
    thing                       : Nat

scratch/main> view thing

  thing : Nat
  thing =
    use Nat +
    use indirect foo
    foo + foo

scratch/main> edit.new thing

  ☝️
  
  I added 1 definitions to the top of scratch.u
  
  You can edit them there, then run `update` to replace the
  definitions currently in this namespace.

```
``` unison :added-by-ucm scratch.u
thing : Nat
thing =
  use Nat +
  use indirect foo
  foo + foo
```
