`namespace` + top level `use` should work. Previously, they didn't.

``` unison
namespace foo
use bar baz
x = 10
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      foo.x : ##Nat
```

``` unison
use bar baz
namespace foo
x = 10
```
