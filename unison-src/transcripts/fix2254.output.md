This transcript checks that updates to data types propagate successfully to dependent types and dependent terms that do pattern matching. First let's create some types and terms:

```unison
unique type A a b c d
  = A a
  | B b
  | C c
  | D d

structural type NeedsA a b = NeedsA (A a b Nat Nat)
                | Zoink Text

f : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
f = cases
  A n -> n
  _ -> 42

f2 a =
  n = f a
  n + 1

f3 : NeedsA Nat Nat -> Nat
f3 = cases
  NeedsA a -> f a + 20
  _ -> 0

g : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
g = cases
  D n -> n
  _ -> 43
```

We'll make our edits in a fork of the `a` namespace:

```ucm
.a> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

    type A a b c d
    structural type NeedsA a b
    f  : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
    f2 : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
    f3 : NeedsA Nat Nat -> Nat
    g  : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat

scratch/main> fork a a2
