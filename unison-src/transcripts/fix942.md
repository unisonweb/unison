```ucm:hide
.> builtins.merge
```

First we add some code:

```unison
x = 0
y = x + 1
z = y + 2
```

```ucm
.> add
```

Now we edit `x` to be `7`, which should make `z` equal `10`:

```unison
x = 7
```

```ucm
.> update
.> view x y z
```

Uh oh! `z` is still referencing the old version. Just to confirm:

```unison
test> t1 = if z == 3 then [Fail "nooo!!!"] else [Ok "great"]
```

```ucm
.> add
.> test
```
