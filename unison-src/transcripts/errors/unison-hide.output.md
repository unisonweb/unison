### Transcript parser hidden errors

When an error is encountered in a `unison:hide` block
then the transcript parser should print the stanza
and surface a helpful message.

```unison
g 3
```



🛑

The transcript failed due to an error in the stanza above. The error is:


  This looks like the start of an expression here 
  
      1 | g 3
  
  but at the file top-level, I expect one of the following:
  
    - A binding, like g = 42 OR
                      g : Nat
                      g = 42
    - A watch expression, like > g + 1
    - An `ability` declaration, like unique ability Foo where ...
    - A `type` declaration, like structural type Optional a = None | Some a
