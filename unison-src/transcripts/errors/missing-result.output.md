### Transcript parser hidden errors

When an error is encountered in a `unison :hide:all` block
then the transcript parser should print the stanza
and surface a helpful message.

``` unison :hide:all
x =
  y = 24
```

ðŸ›‘

The transcript failed due to an error in the stanza above. The error is:

``` 
The last element of a block must be an expression, but this is a
definition:

    2 |   y = 24

Try adding an expression at the end of the block.
```
