Since this code block is expecting an error, we still hide it. It seems unusual to want to hide an error, but maybe itâ€™s just too verbose or something. This follows the authorâ€™s intent.

``` unison :hide:error
x + x +
```

For comparison, here is what we get without the `:hide`.

``` unison :error
x + x +
```

``` ucm :added-by-ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:

      1 | x + x +


  I was surprised to find a x here.
  I was expecting one of these instead:

  * ability
  * namespace
  * newline or semicolon
  * type
  * use
```

Even though this code block has `:hide` on it, we should still see the error output, because it wasnâ€™t expecting an error.

``` unison :hide
x + x +
```
