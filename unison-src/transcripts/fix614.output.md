This transcript demonstrates that Unison forces actions in blocks to have a return type of `()`.

This works, as expected:

```unison
structural ability Stream a where emit : a -> ()

ex1 = do
  Stream.emit 1 
  Stream.emit 2
  42
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      structural ability Stream a
      ex1 : '{Stream Nat} Nat

```
This does not typecheck, we've accidentally underapplied `Stream.emit`:

```unison
ex2 = do
  Stream.emit
  42
```

```ucm

  I found a value  of type:  a ->{Stream a} Unit
  where I expected to find:  Unit
  
      2 |   Stream.emit
  
  Hint: Actions within a block must have type Unit.
        Use _ = <expr> to ignore a result.

```
We can explicitly ignore an unused result like so:

```unison
ex3 = do
  _ = Stream.emit
  ()
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      ex3 : '()

```
Using a helper function like `void` also works fine:

```unison
void x = ()

ex4 =
  void [1,2,3]
  ()
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      ex4  : ()
      void : x -> ()

```
One more example:

```unison
ex4 =
  [1,2,3] -- no good
  ()
```

```ucm

  I found a value  of type:  [Nat]
  where I expected to find:  Unit
  
      2 |   [1,2,3] -- no good
  
  Hint: Actions within a block must have type Unit.
        Use _ = <expr> to ignore a result.

```
