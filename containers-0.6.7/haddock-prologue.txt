This package contains efficient general-purpose implementations
of various immutable container types including sets, maps, sequences,
trees, and graphs.

For a walkthrough of what this package provides with examples of common
operations see the [containers
introduction](https://haskell-containers.readthedocs.io).

The declared cost of each operation is either worst-case or amortized, but
remains valid even if structures are shared.
