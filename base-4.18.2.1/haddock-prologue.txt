Haskell's base library provides, among other things, core types (e.g. [Bool]("Data.Bool") and [Int]("Data.Int")),
data structures (e.g. [List]("Data.List"), [Tuple]("Data.Tuple") and [Maybe]("Data.Maybe")),
the [Exception]("Control.Exception") mechanism, and the [IO]("System.IO") & [Concurrency]("Control.Concurrent") operations.
The "Prelude" module, which is imported by default, exposes a curated set of types and functions from other modules.

Other data structures like [Map](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers/docs/Data-Map.html),
[Set](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers/docs/Data-Set.html) are available in the [containers](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers) library.
To work with textual data, use the [text](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text/docs/Data-Text.html) library.
