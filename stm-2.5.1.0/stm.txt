-- | Software Transactional Memory
--   
--   Software Transactional Memory, or STM, is an abstraction for
--   concurrent communication. The main benefits of STM are
--   <i>composability</i> and <i>modularity</i>. That is, using STM you can
--   write concurrent abstractions that can be easily composed with any
--   other abstraction built using STM, without exposing the details of how
--   your abstraction ensures safety. This is typically not the case with
--   other forms of concurrent communication, such as locks or
--   <a>MVar</a>s.

-- | <a>TBQueue</a> is a bounded version of <tt>TQueue</tt>. The queue has
--   a maximum capacity set when it is created. If the queue already
--   contains the maximum number of elements, then <a>writeTBQueue</a>
--   blocks until an element is removed from the queue.
--   
--   The implementation is based on the traditional purely-functional queue
--   representation that uses two lists to obtain amortised <i>O(1)</i>
--   enqueue and dequeue operations.

-- | <tt>IO</tt> version of <a>newTBQueue</a>. This is useful for creating
--   top-level <a>TBQueue</a>s using <a>unsafePerformIO</a>, because using

-- | Build and return a new instance of <a>TChan</a>
newTChan :: STM (TChan a)

-- | <tt>IO</tt> version of <a>newTChan</a>. This is useful for creating
--   top-level <a>TChan</a>s using <a>unsafePerformIO</a>, because using
--   <a>atomically</a> inside <a>unsafePerformIO</a> isn't possible.
newTChanIO :: IO (TChan a)

-- | Create a write-only <a>TChan</a>. More precisely, <a>readTChan</a>
--   will <a>retry</a> even after items have been written to the channel.
--   The only way to read a broadcast channel is to duplicate it with
--   <a>dupTChan</a>.
--   
--   Consider a server that broadcasts messages to clients:
--   
--   <pre>
--   serve :: TChan Message -&gt; Client -&gt; IO loop
--   serve broadcastChan client = do
--       myChan &lt;- dupTChan broadcastChan
--       forever $ do
--           message &lt;- readTChan myChan
--           send client message
--   </pre>
--   
--   The problem with using <a>newTChan</a> to create the broadcast channel
--   is that if it is only written to and never read, items will pile up in
--   memory. By using <a>newBroadcastTChan</a> to create the broadcast
--   channel, items can be garbage collected after clients have seen them.
newBroadcastTChan :: STM (TChan a)

-- | <tt>IO</tt> version of <a>newBroadcastTChan</a>.
newBroadcastTChanIO :: IO (TChan a)

-- | Duplicate a <a>TChan</a>: the duplicate channel begins empty, but data

--   Hence this creates a kind of broadcast channel, where data written by
--   anyone is seen by everyone else.

--   Note that invariant checking (namely the <tt>always</tt> and

--   which can perform the invariant checking without help from the runtime
--   system.
module Control.Monad.STM

-- | A monad supporting atomic memory transactions.
data () => STM a

-- | Perform a series of STM actions atomically.
--   
--   Using <a>atomically</a> inside an <a>unsafePerformIO</a> or
--   <a>unsafeInterleaveIO</a> subverts some of guarantees that STM
--   provides. It makes it possible to run a transaction inside of another
--   transaction, depending on when the thunk is evaluated. If a nested
--   transaction is attempted, an exception is thrown by the runtime. It is
--   possible to safely use <a>atomically</a> inside <a>unsafePerformIO</a>
--   or <a>unsafeInterleaveIO</a>, but the typechecker does not rule out
--   programs that may attempt nested transactions, meaning that the
--   programmer must take special care to prevent these.
--   
--   However, there are functions for creating transactional variables that
--   can always be safely called in <a>unsafePerformIO</a>. See:
--   <a>newTVarIO</a>, <a>newTChanIO</a>, <a>newBroadcastTChanIO</a>,
--   <a>newTQueueIO</a>, <a>newTBQueueIO</a>, and <a>newTMVarIO</a>.
--   
--   Using <a>unsafePerformIO</a> inside of <a>atomically</a> is also
--   dangerous but for different reasons. See <a>unsafeIOToSTM</a> for more
--   on this.
atomically :: STM a -> IO a

-- | Retry execution of the current memory transaction because it has seen
--   values in <a>TVar</a>s which mean that it should not continue (e.g.
--   the <a>TVar</a>s represent a shared buffer that is now empty). The
--   implementation may block the thread until one of the <a>TVar</a>s that
--   it has read from has been updated. (GHC only)
retry :: STM a

-- | Compose two alternative STM actions (GHC only).
--   
--   If the first action completes without retrying then it forms the
--   result of the <a>orElse</a>. Otherwise, if the first action retries,
--   then the second action is tried in its place. If both actions retry
--   then the <a>orElse</a> as a whole retries.
orElse :: STM a -> STM a -> STM a

-- | Check that the boolean condition is true and, if not, <a>retry</a>.
--   
--   In other words, <tt>check b = unless b retry</tt>.
check :: Bool -> STM ()

-- | A variant of <a>throw</a> that can only be used within the <a>STM</a>
--   monad.
--   
--   Throwing an exception in <tt>STM</tt> aborts the transaction and
--   propagates the exception. If the exception is caught via
--   <a>catchSTM</a>, only the changes enclosed by the catch are rolled
--   back; changes made outside of <a>catchSTM</a> persist.
--   
--   If the exception is not caught inside of the <a>STM</a>, it is
--   re-thrown by <a>atomically</a>, and the entire <a>STM</a> is rolled
--   back.
--   
--   Although <a>throwSTM</a> has a type that is an instance of the type of
--   <a>throw</a>, the two functions are subtly different:
--   
--   <pre>
--   throw e    `seq` x  ===&gt; throw e
--   throwSTM e `seq` x  ===&gt; x
--   </pre>
--   
--   The first example will cause the exception <tt>e</tt> to be raised,
--   whereas the second one won't. In fact, <a>throwSTM</a> will only cause
--   an exception to be raised when it is used within the <a>STM</a> monad.
--   The <a>throwSTM</a> variant should be used in preference to
--   <a>throw</a> to raise an exception within the <a>STM</a> monad because
--   it guarantees ordering with respect to other <a>STM</a> operations,
--   whereas <a>throw</a> does not.
