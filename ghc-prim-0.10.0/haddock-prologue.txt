This package contains the primitive types and operations supplied by GHC.
It is an internal package, only for the use of GHC developers.
GHC users should not use it!  If you do use it then expect
breaking changes at any time without warning.  You should prefer
to import @GHC.Exts@ from the @base@ package instead.
