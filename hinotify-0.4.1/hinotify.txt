-- | Haskell binding to inotify
--   
--   This library provides a wrapper to the Linux Kernel's inotify feature,
--   allowing applications to subscribe to notifications when a file is
--   accessed or modified.
@package hinotify
@version 0.4.1


-- | A Haskell binding to INotify. See
--   <a>http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/inotify/</a> and
--   <tt>man inotify</tt>.
--   
--   Use <a>initINotify</a> to get a <a>INotify</a>, then use
--   <a>addWatch</a> to add a watch on a file or directory. Select which
--   events you're interested in with <a>EventVariety</a>, which
--   corresponds to the <a>Event</a> events.
--   
--   Use <a>removeWatch</a> once you don't want to watch a file any more.
