Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser
library.  It is simple, safe, well documented (on the package
homepage), has extensive libraries, good error messages,
and is fast.  It is defined as a monad transformer that can be
stacked on arbitrary monads, and it is also parametric in the
input stream type.

The main entry point is the "Text.Parsec" module which provides
defaults for parsing 'Char'acter data.

The "Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec" module hierarchy contains
the legacy @parsec-2@ API and may be removed at some point in
the future.
