module Data.X509.Validation

-- | identification of the connection consisting of the fully qualified
--   host name (e.g. www.example.com) and an optional suffix.
--   
--   The suffix is not used by the validation process, but is used by the
--   optional cache to identity certificate per service on a specific host.
--   For example, one might have a different certificate on 2 differents
--   ports (443 and 995) for the same host.
--   
--   for TCP connection, it's recommended to use: :port, or :service for
--   the suffix.

-- | Possible reason of certificate and chain failure.
--   
--   The values <a>InvalidName</a> and <a>InvalidWildcard</a> are
--   internal-only and are never returned by the validation functions.
--   <a>NameMismatch</a> is returned instead.

--   No fingerprints will be added after the instance is created.
--   
--   The underlying structure for the check is kept as a list, as usually
--   the exception list will be short, but when the list go above a dozen
--   exceptions it's recommended to use another cache mechanism with a
--   faster lookup mechanism (hashtable, map, etc).
--   
--   Note that only one fingerprint is allowed per ServiceID, for other
--   use, another cache mechanism need to be use.
