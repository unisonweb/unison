This package used to provide an implementation of the standard 'Integer'
type based on the
<http://gmplib.org/ GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)>.

It is now deprecated in favor of the 'ghc-bignum' package.

Its purpose is to provide backward compatibility for codes directly
depending on the `integer-gmp` package.
